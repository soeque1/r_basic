"65773","Did not work","Elliot","R38RIJCGY29QJS","I purchased this and redeemed it for the corresponding airtime.  The next day, I found that the newly-added time had been removed from my account, leaving me without airtime.  I do not know why or how this happened.  I could not call Tracfone customer service because I had no more airtime.  I then tried to reach Tracfone online and was given a link to a chatroom to chat with a customer service representative who never appeared.  I needed cell phone service for my job so I switched to Verizon.After contacting the seller on Amazon, the airtime PIN was reactivated, which would presumably allow me to redeem the airtime I had purchased.  However, this happened after I had already attempted to work with Tracfone's (nonexistent) customer service, failed, and switched to Verizon.This product was faulty.  Complaining to the seller on Amazon may solve the problem but Tracfone's own customer service department is futile.  Based on my experience, I do not recommend this product.","2014-01-15",0

Customer service said different phones have different servers, so now I'm stuck with a phone that rarely works!?! Switching back to our former provider. Triple minutes are no good if the phone doesn't work.","2014-01-12",0
"96908","Nice to look at, but a godawful piece of technology. It's like running dial-up AOL circa 1998.","Jules","R3CRKQWOSQ4HXK","I really wanted to love this phone! I was against getting an iPhone, but wanted an Android that was about the same size, which fellow smartphone shoppers know is getting stupidly more difficult.I finally bought an unlocked HTC One V about a year ago. I am not a heavy user, I have barely any games and just call/text/take pictures. I don't download apps if they are unnecessary. After nearly a year of use, I need to vent my frustrations:1. The camera is awful. Every picture is WAY too bright, the white balance is all over the place. This is one of the most frustrating things considering every photo you take has these awful spots of shine that can't be corrected away with wholesale filters via photo editing software. No, I don't use my phone for professional photography - but the few times that a photo comes out clear, the light is way too sharp. The light sensor is just way too sensitive, which is a shame because it means photos are taken very quickly.2. Everything relating to Contacts Storage results in text messaging taking literally 5 minutes to open, constantly flashing back to the main messages screen when I click on a thread, and just general frustration. Forget trying to send a picture message from your gallery, the contact's name will take forever to show up. This has to do with a HTC One V software bug (a friend with an HTC One has no issue), where Contacts Storage ends up taking 50mb instead of the normal 3mb of space. But even when I synced all my contacts to Google and cleared everything, it still gives me issues. I have to close out all the programs all the time and restart the damn thing every week or so so the phone can even deal with the minimal things I'm doing.3. The processor is just generally so effing slow. I don't know what the issue is. Things will freeze randomly every once in awhile, and this is especially idiotic considering I do not use an hardcore apps at all.In short, if you use your phone for social purposes at all (calling, texting, photos, games, apps, etc.), THIS TECHNOLOGY IS PATHETIC. I paid a lot of money for this thing and did not expect something that works like it was designed in 2001.The good things:1. It looks really nice. The little bend at the bottom is unique and practical for grip, but doesn't jut out enough to get in the way. The black aluminum body has a great feel and it's just heavy enough to be sturdy. The phone itself is slim.2. Interface is easy to learn and to customize.3. Aside from the contacts-related silliness mentioned above, it works with T-Mobile fine.That's it. I HATE THIS PHONE. Good job, Android, in creating a piece of technology that will drive even a staunch iPhone-hater to the iPhone.","2014-01-04",0

"119891","No negative star option...","Roni K.","RJUDGDKAP62A6","This was my first smart phone.  I chose it for the qwerty keyboard because I was forever making typos on my husband's iPhone.  I wish I had researched this more before making my purchase.This phone locks up regularly, resets itself for no reason in the middle of the night when no one is even near it and that's just the beginning.  I'll go to sleep with all my notification options set to one thing and wake up to it having decided it doesn't like my choices so it has changed them.  The battery on it is beyond weak.  It runs out in next to no time.  Keep the gps off unless you absolutely need it.  I have had this phone lock up to the point of having to wait until the battery runs out so it will reset before I can use it again.  Which is probably the only good reason for having such a terrible battery, at least I didn't have to wait too long.At first it was a nice phone.  About two months after owning it though, the problems began.  It locks up if I receive a text while I am typing one to send. I can no longer send or receive pictures via texts.  The camera function takes terrible pictures.  And if you are trying to take a picture in a dim room, expect the entire thing to come out black.  I am forever getting Genius Button errors when I don't even use that option and have repeatedly had to turn it off completely.  But because it is part of the phone, every time I reboot it automatically comes back on.Unfortunately I could go on, as I have many more such stories about just how poor it is.  I really have nothing nice to say about this phone.  It's a waste of money.","2014-01-31",0

However, the glass screen had numerous cracks, the entire phone was scratched, and the port cover on the bottom (where charger attaches) was missing.  As one of the main features of the Active model is that it is waterproof, the missing port cover rendered it useless.  Since I really did want the phone (it was purchased as a gift for my son), I was willing to pay to have it fixed, and in fact made several attempts to find a local place to repair it.  NONE of the places I checked with, including Radio Shack, would fix it.  Some of them said they would fix other Samsung phones, but not the Active model.  At first the seller tried to say that the description on Amazon said that the phone was cracked, and that it was as is and could not be returned.  However, I immediately pdf'd a copy of my actual order, which said nothing about cracks and described the phone as in very good condition.  I then returned the phone and received a refund.","2014-01-22",0

"120216","Buy a different phone","Chi Ken","R2F8KV99I36QHI","I wanted an inexpensive unlocked dual sim phone for international travel.Ostensibly that is what this phone is, but the BLU 172i phone has numerous problems.The most fundamental for me is that my ATT GoPhone sim works for a while, then the next time I turn on this phone I get emergency only use instead of recognition that the SIM is associated with a current ATT prepaid account. This may be an issue with ATT prepaid sims and some phones, although the ATT prepaid website says customers can move their sim. I did read, on the ATT forum, of another ATT customer having this problem with a new ATT-branded Z431, but it does not seem to happen to most phone changers or there would be a lot more complaints. At a minimum ATT prepaid users need to be aware of this issue.Second biggest problem is the retainer/socket for the microSD card is very poorly made, and mine will not hold a microSD card in place (it locks into place just fine without a microSD card.) Too bad it was not made like the sim sockets.Third, not only is the BLU 172i (which has a camera) unable to send or receive pictures (it lacks mms support) it also can not reply to text messages sent as email (to phonenumber@txt.att.net) although the text of the message comes through fine. The sender's email address shows as a string of digits. Replying to the message gets error messages (and my sim stops working).An online manual would also be very welcome. Hopefully it would do a better job of indicating the limits of this phone.I do hope that BLU fixes these issues in some future model, since this phone is almost good enough to meet my needs.As it is now I do not recommend this phone for anyone.","2014-01-05",0

"83001","Worst phone of life","Alexandra King","R1F7BPD5X727JB","I'm not the kind of mobile user who cares about data, apps, or fancy functions on my phone. I'm uninterested in iPhones and the latest 'hot' devices. Really. I just want a phone that reliably calls, texts, acts as my alarm clock and takes photos occasionally, in that order. I should also point out that I managed to avoid owning a smartphone before getting the Motorola Motoluxe, largely due to the fact I'm on a tight budget and phones feature pretty low on my priority list. Of all the phones I've owned in my life, right from my first 1998 brick starter-phone, the Motoluxe is by far the worst phone I've encountered. Amongst the features you can look forward to if you purchase this phone are the following:- It will freeze constantly, often during the middle of composing texts, where the onscreen keypad will disappear and refuse to reappear on the screen more than 2 seconds at a time- Got the fingers of a 2-month old infant? Awesome, you'll need them for the touchscreen- Don't think about charging this badboy during the night and expecting it to work the next day! It will freeze at 5:57am and your alarm will fail to go off. Every. Single. Time.- Oh yeah your battery will also die for no apparent reason, mere hours after charging it fully- Accessing your camera is clunky and slow, and accessing your photo gallery even worse. Good luck keeping that carefully selected photo of that beautiful haircut to show your hairdresser up on the screen longer than a few seconds!- Predictably, receiving texts is often unreliable. Expect to be accused of ignoring your friends.- Calculator works pretty greatThis phone is the worst. I should have stuck with my 1998 brick. FYI I got this phone in May 2013.Phone manufacturers, PLEASE design phones for longer use than 6 months. Some of us aren't planning on upgrading twice a year!","2014-01-16",0

The second year was all about suffering through until I was eligible for an upgrade. It finally completely died two weeks after the GN 3 came out. So, because I loved all the features and size of the phablet and assumed the device would be better than my last, I purchased the GN 3. Three days later people started telling me my voice cut out for several seconds while talking to them, then they started complaining there was a loud echo. Since I was within the 14 day return period, I returned the phone and got another new one. That solved the problem temporarily, but a few weeks later I started getting complaints again. I went back to AT&T; and this time they reset the phone which unfortunately made me lose my calendar, but once again the phone seemed to work, at least for a while. Within about six weeks the complaints from my clients and family were coming in several times a day. Another bum phone!! All AT&T; wants to do is send me a refurbished phone under the warranty. I've tried and tried to get them to understand that I paid for a new phone THAT WORKED and I've never gotten that. They really don't care.

Then a little while later something with the slider changed and I had to open the slider very carefully or that would cause it to shut off. Next was the annoying pause required to send a text without it creating a multi-person text field. Then the battery stopped registering its charge correctly so it always looks like it is dead. It randomly dials people when it's in my purse. If I touch it when its ringing, just touch it, it sometimes answers even if I don't want to answer. It randomly turns on the Verizon app. Not sure if this is an issue with the phone or phone service, but I can get texts hours after they were initially sent. Basically nothing actually works the way it's supposed to. Everything is completely random. It is absolutely the worst phone ever. I'd never do it again.","2014-02-07",0

Unfortunately, you can't remove those apps.  I hate it when companies tell me how my computing devices have to be configured.Then there's the Android File Transfer program for Macs.  Worst design and implementation I've ever seen from any respectable manufacturer, which Motorola isn't (or wasn't, given they belonged to Google and now to Lenovo).  Load one music file on the phone, and, if the load even completes, at the end, or somewhere in the middle, the device will stop communicating with your computer, necessitating a reboot of the phone.Now imagine that you have a 32GB card and at least 16GB in audio to download.

Never had that problem so regularly on other phones.I have not had Siri before but it is worthless on my phone.

Activated it anyways since I didn't want to hear complaints form a family member not having a phone any longer. The device does not work properly. Areas of the touch screen do not respond to input, The load speed for anything is horrendous, and there's a slightly visible oval of something in the touch screen.Attempted to contact for a replacement but they were not willing to work inside the parameters I set for the exchange so they are now getting a bad rating after I tried to work with them after they blatantly lied regarding the listing of this phone.##Phone: Malfunctioning refurbished unit##Battery: Non OEM battery. Took forever to charge and wears through the charge extremely fast##Charger: Non OEM charger so don't expect to be able to perform any data transfers even it it did work proper. Motorola has a proprietary pin setup in their OEM cords that allows data transfer while secondary market chargers and cords do not meet this standard. It will charge the phone just fine.I am a previous owner of this model of phone and I am very familiar with the performance that should be expected from it and if I didn't know any better I'd say this was some cheap knock-ff in a Droid Bionic casing.","2014-02-11",0

I mean, it will freeze up in you are listening to Pandora and trying to track your running miles. Everything lags in opening and functioning. I don't even trust the alarm clock on this POS. It's really heavy for it's size and the physical keyboard is pretty cramp and I have really small hands! The keys feel like you have to smash it down for the phone to recognize that you are typing. I end up having to use the touch screen to text constantly and the main reason I got this was for a physical keyboard.

I went 4, yes FOUR times to their store in my neighborhood and called them a couple of times until they allowed an exchange for which I had to pay $25. Now I'm on my second Alcatel and it keeps failing. When I touch the phone icon to make a call, it takes at least 5-10 seconds for the keypad to appear. It is moody, somedays, like today, the screen will go black, I can't text. I don't agree with comments that say: you get what you pay for. They are selling a phone.

"74440","Arc S - Low quality phone, with Android OS","RS","RTYUQOZJOCXJ8","The keys don't respond to the fingers properly, it is virtually impossible to key an SMS message without errors. The spelling check of the words in any language, is most times wrong and messages have to be corrected 5-6 times before they become correct. A lot of intensive keying, much more than with a normal dumb phone.The worst phone I've ever had, very low quality. It was a waste of money (more than 300 Euros, 380 USD), that could have been used in a quality product from the competition. The Android system doesn't help, as most of these problems are a combination of hardwarde and software flaws. Applications are resource intensive (lots of memory and processor hungry) and low quality in general. I bought three Xperia (two ARC S and one Xperia X) for the family and it's the same low quality and problems all over. Also due to the ARC design, the phone cannot stay flat on a table. When you press the screen it moves and doesn't stay stable (but this is not the reason why it doesn't accept the key entries. The permanent errors with the key entries happen when you hold the phone and it's stable in your hand).This review applies to both Xperia Arc S and X as I have both.Also it turns off by itself many times, suddenly and without warning. You have to keep checking all the time if the phone is on.","2014-02-22",0

I add my almost everyday and by the end of the day it will not recognize my finger print.The keypad is a nightmare. As I said I have had IPhones before. This one is so sensitive (and I have fat fingers) that I can never get a message out without getting a cap rather than an a and/or several other mistakes that autocorrect invariably screws up. Never had that problem so regularly on other phones.I have not had Siri before but it is worthless on my phone. I have used voice recognition programs on my computers and never had problems there so I have a hard time imagining it is my voice but most of the time I cannot get Siri to work well enough to use it.All in all this phone is a nightmare but maybe it is a lemon.","2014-02-04",0

I called Applecare for a question and had so much difficulty to read the serial number under settings. The serial number font is too small and in light gray!!!! I gave the wrong serial number to the apple care agent and the he added my name to someone else's account. Finally I took the phone under a bright light and managed to read and give the correct serial number to the agent. It seems that people who designed the new 5s screens do not have good common sense and Apple has not had proper review of the visual design before making the phone available to the public. My old iPhone 4 screen design was much much better. Also I do not understand why Apple insists to keep the phone screen size so small? This is making reading or watching video's really unpleasant.","2014-02-08",0

"134244","Great phone, poor quality control","Ike Mcfadden Ike Mcfadden","R3JPW5AU7LZA1F","The Xperia ZL is a great piece of technology.  Fast processor, excellent HD screen, reasonable battery life.Alas, for reasons unclear to me at present, the phone died within 60 days of purchase.When I say died, please allow me to be more specific.  I'm fairly tech-savvy, and do not remotely give up at the first sign of trouble.  Alas, this phone beat me.Seemingly at random one afternoon, the phone's touch-screen stopped responding to input.  So...that pretty much means the phone is, for all intents and purposes...dead.  I attempted the following basic solutions:1) Factory Reset2) Repair option on the Sony Bridge / desktop app3) Reinstall OS / Flash OSUnfortunately, none of these worked.  The phone, even after reinstalling the drivers and firmware, continue to be unresponsive on the touch-screen.I spoke to Sony's warranty department.  And unfortunately, since I'm in Europe at the moment where the specific LTE model is not sold...I'm basically out of luck.  No suggestions from Sony, other than to ship it back to a regional repair site in North America.So in the end...I spend a good $600 or so...on a phone that functioned...for about 60 days.Unfortunately, Sony's entire Z-line of products seems to be plagues with several instant death problems.  Unfortunately what I experienced is not uncommon.  Just dig around google a bit; you'll see.So...if you'd like to pay $10/day for a phone on average...that will become a brick within 60 days...well, look no further.","2014-03-05",0

"85188","Stay far away from this company, I got scammed","Gulf Coast Livin Rob","R36RLC4FB3TZLN","I cannot emphasize this enough - stay far, far away from this company.  I purchased this product from a Walmart store for my elderly mother.  I was unable to activate device.  Called customer support and this is where the real nightmare began.  After a long wait, the first rep was unable to fix the problem.  So, she put me on another long hold for technical support, who was also unable to activate the product, doing nothing more than the first rep to attempt to remedy the problem.  After a total of 2 hours later, I was told I must call back the next day because the would need to check with Verizon to see if there were any issues in my area with coverage.  Now keep this in mind, I spent all this time with them on setup and the phone on my VERIZON wireless cell with 5 bars of full coverage, of which they were made aware.  After over 2 hours of setting up online and dealing with reps who did nothing more than the manual suggested, I decided to return the defective product, as the rep told me maybe the product was defective and I agreed.  I returned the item to Walmart for a full refund.  I called the company to inform them to remove my mother's credit card information from their system and remove the activation charge of $26+ (since they were unable to activate the product) and I was told there would be a $10 RESTOCKING FEE!!  I told them Walmart does not charge a restocking fee and that is from whom I bought it.  They told me Walmart will send the item back to them and since they have my mother's credit card info, they would only refund the activation fee less the RESTOCKING FEE.  This is theft.  I never bought the product from them so they have no legal right to do this.  No matter what I said the rep told me 5 Star would deduct this fee from the activation charge.  I was absolutely infuriated and stunned.  This was one of the biggest scams and ripoffs I have been a part of.  The rep tried to force me into receiving another device by mail at a $10 discount (the same price as online vs. in-store).  Because of the terrible experience with the reps and the activation, I was concerned this device would not function properly when my mother needed it.  Now this isn't over because I will be forced to file a dispute with my mother's credit card company in order to receive the full refund.  NOTHING LESS THAN SCAM ARTISTS.  The reps have been trained to be sweet and smile while they kick and push you to the ground, acting as if everything is wonderful while they scam you.  I can't imagine how many elderly folks they are scamming.  It's just disgusting.  Run from this company.  Even if your device is activated, you will not regret the decision as they will find a way to scam you in the future if they can.  John Walsh and companies that carry the product should be ashamed for selling this product sold by such a shady company.What's next...a response from GreatCall telling me I should contact them so they can discuss this situation...","2014-03-22",0

"162166","stay away from the galaxy note 3!!","Paul McDonald","RTOI821OMZU37","So, I got this phone using Verizon Edge program - ordered over the phone. When I received it, it wouldn't activate. The SIM card number wasn't on the order. I had to pry the SIM card out of the Note 3, which is NOT an easy thing to do! I had to do this to read the SIM card number to Verizon Wireless, so they could activate it.I noticed that when I had device on maximum brightness (NOT on Automatic) and was working on something over extended amount of time, the brightness would dim for a few seconds, then return to max. This would keep happening, at random intervals, and to seemingly random brightness levels. If I continued still to use it... say after 45 minutes or something, it would dim to MINIMUM brightness for few seconds.Now, it wouldn't show me or tell me in any way what brightness level it was changing to... I could just tell when it was putting to MINIMUM brightness. I got it replaced for another Note 3... The replacement had same issue... I called Verizon Wireless and then they revealed to me that this was a feature built into device by the manufacturer. I even spoke to Samsung to verify this.So, stay away from the Galaxy Note 3 at ALL COSTS! ANYONE that owned this device might need to operate the device on maximum brightness for extended amount of time... I mean, why have a long life battery, quad core cpu, and 3 gb RAM, if you can't fully utilize them? So, this phone does this to prevent overheating. Why would a $700 phone have a problem with overheating!?!STAY AWAY FROM THE GALAXY NOTE 3!","2014-04-03",0

Before purchasing, we checked the coverage area listed online- using our zip code- and were delighted to see that we were covered. It was promptly ordered through Prime with their great two-day service. We just received this item and tried to activate it. Imagine our dismay in being told by the operator that we are NOT in the coverage area and would not be able to use this device. I have no choice but to send it back. Thank goodness, I ordered it from Amazon!Don't trust the company's (Great Call) online information. Call directly to find out if you are indeed covered before ordering this and spare yourself the trouble of having to file a return claim.","2014-04-26",0
"79697","Where do I begin???","Juliebug","RG4J1PIV7DOBC","I hate this phone.  My LG with ATT died before its time, no replacement through ATT without paying through the nose.  I only wanted a good basic phone, good texting, easy to use, nothing fancy.  This one was terrible.  There are some very simple features that it lacks and I am NOT a feature-centric person with my phones.  I have the Kindle Fire, which I use with my ATT data plan.  I did not want a smart phone.An example of one of the many features that it doesn't have is this:  The alarm system, so simple, right?  I've never had a phone with such limitations on its alarm feature.  You can set an alarm for once M-F F-Su or EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK!  You cannot pick specific days for a particular alarm. I work M, We, Th, and get up at 4:00 a.m.  I do not want to have to turn the alarm off and on every stinking day.  And I sure as hell don't want to get up at 4 a.m. on the days that I don't work!  This alone made this phone a dud.  I was going to just suck it up and keep the phone until I could get another decent phone from ATT but the port was bad on this phone and I returned it just in the nick of time.  I replaced it with the ZTE Z431 Unlocked GSM Phone and I am VERY happy with it.If you offered this phone to me for free with free replacements at any time, I would decline the offer, Terrible phone.","2014-04-25",0

I called HTC and told them that performance was taking a nose-dive, the battery lasted half a day with regular use, and the phone would drop cell service all the time. Their solution? They mailed me a new SIM card holder... are you kidding me? What a joke. They jerked me around until I hit 12 months, and I went over the warranty period.Problems with this phone include but not limited to:* Freezing. Apps crash often. The HTC UI will crash too. I'll go to the home screen and the UI will take 30 seconds to return.* HORRIBLE battery life. I have to charge the phone twice a day, and sometimes three.* Drops cell service consistently. Too, friends have 4 bars with AT&T; while I consistently have 1 or 2 less.* No removable battery. Really? This is just a gimmick to earn money from users needing battery replacements.* No expandable storage.* The most free memory (RAM) I can ever get is around 150MB. The rest of the 1GB is spent on the OS and HTC background apps. * This thing gets HOT. If it weren't for the Otterbox, you wouldn't be able to hold it comfortably.* HORRIBLE support from HTC. They had zero interest in solving my problem.I'll be buying a different brand as soon as I can. This phone needs to be taken out back and shot.","2014-04-28",0

"164181","Worst Android I Have Seen","Keith A. Hire musician","R18UCGZV5LS3DN","I  have used cell phones since the eighties, when I sold them. I am not on my phone a lot, but still like to carry a cell so I can make and receive calls when necessary. I have used prepaid phones for the last 15 years or so, because they really fit my needs. I also like Tracfone because their prices and coverage are very hard to beat (don't get me started about their service). I have a computer background and always wanted a smartphone, but couldn't justify the cost of an IPhone and a long contract. When prepaid Androids started becoming available a few years ago, I tried several different Androids from several different carriers, but have always ended up with a bad phone, bad coverage, or have paid for minutes I didn't use. I was one of those people waiting for Tracfone to offer Androids.Last fall, when Tracfone moved in that direction, I checked over the specs and reviews for the 3 Androids they offered, and decided on the Valet. What a mistake! The first phone they sent me froze up and could not be activated, so I had to wait 2 weeks for a replacement. The replacement phone is extremely slow and buggy, and freezes up regularly. It regularly launches apps or turns on the camera or the calculator in the middle of a phone call. The touch screen is unresponsive, and sometimes has to be punched repeatedly to make things work. I get 1 or 2 bars on my home wifi when I am 20-25 feet from the router. This phone came out last fall, and the price is already being cut 50% - this should tell you something.The LG Optimus Dynamic ll is a few dollars more, but has a bigger screen, is quicker and more responsive (using the same size processor), and has a more attractive design. To me it is entirely superior to the Valet. I haven't used the other Tracfone Androids, so I can't comment on them, but I can tell you that the ZTE Valet is a terrible turkey and a must to avoid.","2014-04-23",0

Seller will give you a cold answer because time has passed and even though they took weeks answering with incomplete information, the 30-days period of changes is over.Now I have a beutiful piece of technology that can't be used in the way that 600 dolars make you to dream on.So, are you looking for a real international version?

Here is the Problem Samsung have 2 version of the S4 for sprint one with tri band that allow the phone to connect to Spark and another without. The Phone Amazon is selling is the old version that doesn't work with Spark. Now I'm having ton of problems because my phone is not capable of receiving service,I Cant received calls, text messages or data.I contacted Amazon but they don't want to do anything because all they have is the old version in stock.Spend 49.99 at best buy or sprint but don't get it here.

"138374","Android memory adventure.","etm","RKUOGX98PDB72","I purchased this phone because only Xperia offers Android phones with SD card. I installed a 32GB card and proceeded to download several maps for offline GPS navigation but soon I run out of storage. To make the long story short you cannot store applications in the SD card, the maps were stored in the internal memory and soon I run out of it. You can only store or transfer photos, videos and music files and your Windows PC will recognize it as 'Xperia SP' storage but you cannot store data files for your games and other application in the SD card to be used by the phone. For more information search 'can't move apps sd card android' and  'Memory in Android devices'. I travel a lot and wanted to have offline GPS maps for the entire world like I used to have in Nokia phones. It was also entertaining to have the entire globe in a tinny memory card, to me it was better than a game. I gave this product one star because I cannot use it to store applications in the SD card. I have not used it as a phone yet.4/13/14 Revision.Above was operator error, I hope others do not make the same mistake. Instead of deleting this review I decided to leave it in place in case someone else experiences the same thing (makes the same mistake). I decided to re-install the apps and noticed that I was asked where to install the apps in the Internal Memory or the External Memory. The SD is considered external memory so I am currently re-installing in the external memory (SD). I will change my rating to 5-stars unless if something goes wrong.4/14/2014 Revision.I re-installed the applications but there was no change. It still installs in the internal storage (5gb) and NOT in the external 32 GB SD card. Unfortunately my initial assessment  was correct. I change my review back to one star. You can also search 'Android rooting' for more information.","2014-04-12",0

"162154","Great phone - bad business practice","Nathan Adams","R2D7HREG71I6T7","Update: I found out it is indeed possible to change the device status from Custom to Official by using third party tools. I haven't tried doing an OTA update yet but I imagine it would work. Still one star for wanting to punish people who want to use their device.The phone itself is great. It's fast, it's slick, lots of storage what's not to like? Well, the manufacturers want to make it harder and harder to run custom roms and acquire root on your device.Here is a secret - root should not void your warranty. That would be like Dell denying a warranty on the simple basis that I wiped Windows and installed Linux (ignoring the fact that Dell does support Linux on a select number of, hidden, systems). (Update: or Dell denying warranty because I reset the password for the local Windows administrator account that I didn't have access to). Yes, installing new ROMs and flashing can brick the device, but Samsung, or any manufacture, should have a device to repair it if something goes wrong. If they don't then I would be highly suspect of their talent as people have been unbricking devices for years using JTAG. I understand that it falls out what normal operations would be - so charge a small fee (~$20) if you have to repair a bricked device due to rooting/flashing. Or an even better idea is a big red button that flashes everything back to factory specs (password protected naturally).In any case, whenever I get a new device I always get root. Not for nefarious reasons, but mainly because certain applications, like my one time password generators don't have a sync option so the only way to get them to a new device is to use titanium backup which requires root. Also, I use titanium backup to freeze the bloat that comes on the phone (seriously samsung?). This way they can't run and don't show up for updates. Low and behold, once I acquired root the updater said my device was modified so you cannot have future updates. What the f is that??? Seriously. What middle manager decided that was a good idea? Instead why don't you say look, you modified your device, this update may break your phone, are you sure you really want to check for updates? Just let me accept the risk - god knows apparently you will do anything to snake out of repairing the device if a hardware failure actually happened.That's my rant and hopefully my review will convince power users to steer clear of this phone.","2014-04-05",0

They said that an email was sent, but I did not receive it.  It was not in spam, or deleted either.  They forwarded the email and here is the turnaround time for a warranty repairThe average turnaround time for all repairs is fifteen (15) business days, but in extreme cases the repair process may take a maximum of thirty (30) business days.You are reading that correctly.  15 - 30 business days.So unless you are good with being without a phone for 1 - 2 months.  DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OK, lets start out by saying I am completely aware that all cell phones have issues.  I currently have 6 phones within my household.  I have have had dozens of phones  Every brand has had a problem at some point in time.I applaud Blu for taking the path of creating an affordable phone that satisfies 95% of what people actually need.  But they have one fatal flaw to the model.  Support!The Life Play that I purchased just 4 short months ago had an issue with the SD card reader.  No matter what card I put in, it says the card is bad and asks to reformat.  Again, these things happen.Here is where the problem begins.  I called in to support and waited for about 30 minutes to speak to someone.  The person was friendly and seemed knowledgable.  The took all of the necessary information, IMEI, Model, part number, problem with the phone etc.  They said that they would be submitting a claim to RMA/Warranty.  Again pretty standard.  He then said that he would send me an email to confirm and that I would here back in 24/48 hours.I received the email which asked for all of the same information, again.  I sent it back immediately.  30+ hours later I had not heard anything, not even a reply that they received the email, so I called back in.  I waited 45 minutes on hold then spoke to the same person who said that they just submitted the claim to RMA/Warranty.  I received the email which states that it would be 3 business days before I here back on the RMA.  So now the process is taking 4 business days to get an RMA answer.  I asked to speak to a manager and waited for an additional 15 minutes.  The manager said that I need to understand that they are the new guy and do not have the infrastructure to support a higher level of customer service and this is the best they can do.So....If you have and issue you will Submit your claim.  Wait 24 - 48 hours to see if your claim is valid, Wait 3 business days form RMA to respond.  Send the phone to them 3 days.  They look at it maybe another 3 days.  They send it back another 3 days.  Grand total:  UP TO 14 BUSINESS DAYS (ALMOST 3 ACTUAL WEEKS) TO HAVE YOUR PHONE FIXED!Morals to the story:1.  If you need a phone with responsive support, this is not the phone for you.2.  BEING THE NEW PHONE MANUFACTURER IS NOT AN EXCUSE FOR POOR SERVICE.  IT SHOULD BE YOUR MAIN PRIORITY!","2014-04-25",0

I bought what was advertised as a Samsung external charger and i9300 battery.

Pulled it out of the box, tried to set it up with my carrier on line, and the phone was recognized as different than what I had thought I purchased.  So I turned it off, contacted the seller, and returned it. I never plugged it into a charger, never changed any settings, never added a single contact, never called or texted a single number. The phone was utterly unused. It had simply been momentarilly turned on. They made the return a huge hassle, being very impolite, unprofessional, and downright rude. At one point, I even had to tell them that there was no need to be so rude. I had to pay return shipping, and even though the shipping on the product was free when I bought it, they then, also deducted shipping from my refund. The refund took about 2 weeks after they received the product, and the refund wasn't even full. They told me the product had been used, and therefore they couldn't refund me fully. The product was NOT used. I'm very upset with the entire scenario that occurred with this seller and I would not recommend them.

The phone is slow, lags, and exhibits the following wonderful traits:1.  WiFi instability issue NEVER fixed since release2.  Muting the phone then restoring sound keeps all volume at 0.  You must manually increase the volume.3.  Text input by Swype will often spell the word but not insert it4.  Loses 4G signal then switches back and cannot send mobile data5.  Slow and laggy.  Gets worse with each update6.  Camera takes smeared, blotchy photos in anything but bright light7.  Screen almost impossible to see in bright daylight8.  Samsung Bloatware sucks up all RAM.  You won't have more than 500 MB of RAM free at any one time9.  Piss poor design means that a muted phone will still BLAST that AT&T; ringtone when the phone spontaneously restarts10.  Music decoding will insert skips into some songs (especially jazz songs)11.  NFC never works well the first time or the second or the third12.  Screen attracts and holds all grease until wiped with pure alcohol13.  Without power saver and auto screen bright, you will get about half a day out of this if you are playing music and doing light browsing.Samsung doesn't give a damn about their customers, they just want a sucker to pay a lot for their beta test phones.

"183670","AT&T; are awful, Samsung are stupid, and Google Sucks","Edwin G. Hartnell","R1GBDV29WFWB1D","After you read this review you are probably going to think the author (me) is half-crazy and I've got nobody to blame but myself. Probably true. But in my defense I am merely a consumer and a first-time Android customer.My problem is that I needed to buy an English phone that worked in China (where I live). Yeah - I could have bought the exact same phone in China, but all the menus and apps would have been in Chinese, and the app payment system would have been linked to the Chinese banking system which I, as a foreigner, don't really have access to. I was really excited about the new Samsung Galaxy S5 and thought the blue phone looked cool, so I waited and waited and waited until it was launched.Launch date arrived and at 12:01 AM I was on Amazon ready to buy (it was lunchtime in China). Nothing. Ok - yeah - there were the Galaxy S5 phones that you could buy from AT&T; but they had already been posted on Amazon for weeks. Nothing had changed, and the blue phones that had been plastered all over were absolutely not available. What had happened to them? A complete mystery!This is why I think Samsung are stupid - their big launch was, in fact, marked only by the complete absence of any marketing activities. Apple's marketing is amazing. But what's even more amazing is that companies like Samsung can't even copy the basic things that Apple do so well. Leading up to the launch Samsung leaked information like a sieve. But after the launch Samsung eliminated all communication. The result was always going to be highly disappointed and frustrated customers!After weeks of more waiting I decided to take the plunge and buy and AT&T; no contract white phone at the full price of $699. I didn't really want AT&T; to be involved, but it seemed like it was my only option. It was, after all, a no contract phone. It just appeared as if Samsung couldn't distribute the phone by themselves and needed AT&T;'s help. My friend then hand-carried the phone over for me and placed it in my tingling hands. But the first message that popped-up on the screen was Enter Your SIM Unlock Code.I contacted AT&T.; They explained it like this: you don't need to have a contract but you do need to have a paid AT&T; service agreement. I challenged them: but if I have a paid service agreement then that would mean that I have a contract. I went to law school so I thought it was a pretty clever argument. But I could not prevail - apparently there are legal exceptions for telecommunication monopolies. This is why I think AT&T; are awful, and why I am begging you never to do business with them!But I took my half-bricked phone and persevered. I wouldn't be able to make phone calls, but at least I'd be able to play Angry Birds.Enter Google. I searched the Google Play Store in vain before finally trying to download Angry Birds from the Rovio website. But after sending me back to Google this message appeared: This app is not available in your country. Definitely not true as I had Angry Birds on my old iPhone. So it must just be that Google sucks. Google, for reasons that are just inexplicable, do not want me to buy Angry Birds or, in fact, any app that requires a payment (yes - I was logged in with a credit card). Why, why, why? I can think of a few evil reasons but I certainly can't think of any good ones.Then, out of nowhere, Samsung start selling international blue phones on Amazon that are $50 cheaper than the AT&T; phones.I really do hate you all!","2014-05-20",0

"174137","Buyer beware do not update to KitKat 4.4","Nilay","RJE5IZDOECCAE","It was working great until I got push notification telling me to upgrade to Android version 4.4 Kitkat. Then it all went down hill. You can look up all the problems this phone has regarding loosing signal, auto toggle airplane mode and no-sim symbol coming on randomly. I've done factory resets several times and according to other users on forums this problem been known by Motorola since January and it is May now. Still there hasn't been any patch or known solutions. According to forums, Motorola tech support wants you to send back the phone so they can downgrade the Android version to 4.3 but then you will keep on being notified to upgrade to KitKat every single day through push Notification. If you have time for this crap then you can go ahead and play tag with Motorola but for $200, I've got better things to do. Clearly, it's going to be an expensive paper weight that allow my kid to play some games on it in when her tablet is charging. I am quite disappointed with Motorola and their ability to solve issues with their products in the reasonable amount of time. What I don't understand is that, why they feel the need to push a new O.S that is not entirely necessary and ruined a perfectly fine hardware capable of many great things at a reasonable price. Whether if it is Motorola problem of KitKat itself is yet to be known and even Motorola tech support stop commenting on forums all over the internet tells me that they have no idea how to fix it. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless there is a known fixed or patch for this issue, which is highly unlikely given the fact that it's been over 5 months they've known about this issue. Put your money towards some other device and save your self some trouble, drop/missed calls while ur phone is on in your pocket and you have no idea the phone has disengage the sim card and remained the same till you open the back of the phone, remove sim and put it back in. That happens several times a day. Hope this helps. Good luck.","2014-05-09",0

"143313","If you like apps, don't buy this phone.  Period.","Michael S.","R21R1N0C02JPFP","No quibbling or politics.  Yes this is a pretty phone.  Camera is decent and it is large like the other more expensive brands. That is where the similarity dies.This phone is an under-capable phone because it does not possess the internal storage needed to install enough apps to justify the size and specs for the rest of the phone.  It is so huge, and has the dual core memory, but a teeny internal storage issue.  After FB, email, and Pandora the phone is acting lethargic and the email stops working because it mismanages App storage.So if you plan on never installing another app, or using the phone to check email, go ahead and give it a shot.But, if you  plan on a couple apps (games, forget it, no internal memory space for that), look elsewhere.  This phone allows for a max of 500MB of internal storage (apps, not pics).  The OS takes about 350MB, so once you install a few other apps, you are within the Warning Range at which apps stop functioning to preserve phone function.PS - there is apparently a way to root the phone and get it to use the whole 2GB of space which would fix the issue.  If anyone has detailed procedures for this, I would volunteer to try it out and report back.","2014-05-07",0

"172628","Loved almost everything about this phone except....","Patricia O. Patricia O.","R31MBSRE39OBQE","I experienced this 3 times with two difference phones and also read that it happens quite often online. Basically, sometimes I accidentally let my battery die out to the point where it shuts off completely. As a college student, that just happens. Normally, with my previous phones I plug it in to charge, it starts charging, and after a couple hours it's good to go. NOT WITH THIS PHONE! The 3 times this has happened, the phone will not charge, will not turn on, and the battery is not removable so there's really nothing you can do about it until it decides to turn on. When the first phone had this issue, Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement free of charge. When this happened AGAIN with the second phone, I just had to return it for good once and for all. You can imagine how much of a hassle and inconvenience this is as a student or even a working professional. The first time the phone did eventually come on after 3 days of battling with it, charging and removing the charger, pressing the power button again and again. I was told it was a problem with the system, the phone is basically wired to not charge unless it is on...so if it has died completely it doesn't charge and cannot come back on. Your best bet is to basically not let it die completely...which, unfortunately, isn't realistic for me.It was a decent phone and it had everything I wanted but I just couldn't deal with that one problem....","2014-05-21",0

"170536","Buyer beware do not update to KitKat 4.4","Nilay","RJE5IZDOECCAE","It was working great until I got push notification telling me to upgrade to Android version 4.4 Kitkat. Then it all went down hill. You can look up all the problems this phone has regarding loosing signal, auto toggle airplane mode and no-sim symbol coming on randomly. I've done factory resets several times and according to other users on forums this problem been known by Motorola since January and it is May now. Still there hasn't been any patch or known solutions. According to forums, Motorola tech support wants you to send back the phone so they can downgrade the Android version to 4.3 but then you will keep on being notified to upgrade to KitKat every single day through push Notification. If you have time for this crap then you can go ahead and play tag with Motorola but for $200, I've got better things to do. Clearly, it's going to be an expensive paper weight that allow my kid to play some games on it in when her tablet is charging. I am quite disappointed with Motorola and their ability to solve issues with their products in the reasonable amount of time. What I don't understand is that, why they feel the need to push a new O.S that is not entirely necessary and ruined a perfectly fine hardware capable of many great things at a reasonable price. Whether if it is Motorola problem of KitKat itself is yet to be known and even Motorola tech support stop commenting on forums all over the internet tells me that they have no idea how to fix it. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless there is a known fixed or patch for this issue, which is highly unlikely given the fact that it's been over 5 months they've known about this issue. Put your money towards some other device and save your self some trouble, drop/missed calls while ur phone is on in your pocket and you have no idea the phone has disengage the sim card and remained the same till you open the back of the phone, remove sim and put it back in. That happens several times a day. Hope this helps. Good luck.","2014-05-09",0

"154888","Motorola Finally Makes a Phone Worth Owning","Timothy Swann","RO9KYVWX09HK9","I purchased this from Moto Maker (on Verizon, the only difference is the radios so this is relevant) during their holiday sale where the off contract price came down to $350. Since I've had this phone for a while now, and I am now equipped to write my review. I wrote one for the Galaxy Nexus(GNex) after that was released since I bought it the day it came out and my review received nearly 200 votes (mostly helpful), so it seems like people found my review useful. I've posted this review for all the different carrier variants since the hardware and software are all the same except for radios.Hardware DesignThe design of this phone is truly one to appreciate. The fact that I was able to customize the look of mine is not the reason I say that. I can say that this phone does not feel like you're holding an iPhone or a Samsung or any other phone for that matter. It does not feel cheaply made (and being made in the US, it isn't!). It had just enough weight and the part on the outside, don't feel like plastic like most Samsung phones. Don't get me wrong, Samsung makes very good phones, but they all feel cheap, but that's my opinion and others feel the same way. I happen to think the Moto X has a premium feel compared to my old GNexThe screen is much more enjoyable than my Gnex was. This is not to say that I didn't like the screen on my GNex because I did, but the colors seem better on the Moto X. Every user will have a different opinion though. Many people like the IPS Retina display on the iPhone and the best comparison to that is the LG G2, which has a great screen. The AMOLED screen on the Moto X is very good for me though.Continuing with the design near the screen, the rounded edges all around the front of the phone actually feel great. What do I mean by that? Since this screen is truly edge to edge, if you find yourself swiping from the edges a lot, you won't feel the sharpness an edge usually feels like.The mic is on the front of the screen and very noticeable, so when using speaker phone and turn the phone face down to have the speaker facing up, it results in the other person hearing an echo. Didn't have that problem with my GNex, but that is probably because the mic was not very visible on the bottom.I do have a gripe about the design of two things though. Perhaps it's because I'm used to have my GNex, but have the volume rocker and the power button on the same side (the right side), feels awkward to me. But Samsung has it correct in my eyes with the volume rocker on the left side and the power button on the right side. The other thing for me is having the micro USB port on the bottom of the phone and the headphone jack on the top. I don't like this part AT ALL. For those that don't have cars that have Bluetooth Streaming, this creates cord clutter. However, there are times where having the headphone jack on the top can be nice. For example, as a runner I take my phone with me on runs and use headphones. Since the cord doesn't need to go to the bottom of the phone that can make that experience better.SoftwareThe first Android phone I had was the Galaxy Nexus. So why do I say that here in this review. Well, I've experienced the software of other android phone through demo units and phones of friends. I don't like skinned versions of Android like what Samsung does to Android on their Galaxy phones. I do truly enjoy the stock Android experience. The Android experience is nearly stock android. There are some small Moto tweaks, but otherwise, it's the experience I enjoy.Active Notifications are truly awesome! Yes, this falls under software. Now what is that? Well instead of a notification light, a portion of the screen turns on when you have a notification, telling you exactly what app the notification is from. You can pick and choose what apps you want to show notifications through this feature. Now you might be wondering is the screen continuously shows this notification until you dismiss it. Well, you can dismiss it if you want to, but you can preview the notification and see if it's an email or a text or whatever app.Now for Touchless control. Some people may find this to be a gimmick, but it's actually not bad. I use it when in the car to make phone calls. That's about it, though occasionally, saying OK Google Now, what's the forecast for today is easier than launching an app. (call me lazy for that, it's true haha).Battery LifeI have been putting my phone through test of my everyday usage. That includes, streaming music in my car, using Google Maps for traffic conditions to and from work, texting, calling, checking personal and work emails, checking Facebook, taking the occasional picture and then some sports-related stuff too. I would imagine the average user might use their phone as much as I do in a typical day. Now, the verdict...it's very good. I was shocked at how well the battery lasted. I got more than a full day's worth of usage out of it (wake up at 5am to sleep at 10pm). That's 17 hours for me. That means most people should be able to get a full day's worth out of this phone before plugging in before going to sleep. Moto really did a fantastic job of optimizing the software, processor and screen to maximize battery life.CameraTruthfully, I haven't taken enough pictures to give a great assessment of this, but coming from my GNex, this takes far better pictures. The pictures I've taken have been in great lighting conditions and the pictures have come out great. If you want to get a good idea on the performance, you can google reviews. Keep in mind when this phone first came out, the camera wasn't great, but that was due to the camera processing software. They have fixed that. Droid-Life has samples of the before and after. They show that Moto fixed this. It's a 10MP shooter and should be good enough for everyone's every day camera taking needs.OtherThrough moto maker the phone came with Android 4.2.2. I have not upgraded to 4.4 yet becaue from what I've seen in forums, in 4.4, Verizon is able to block tethering for those who still have unlimited data (like me). I'm holding off on installing the update for now.","2014-01-02",1

It is clear, crisp and responsive and an absolute joy to work on. But at full brightness, it does suck the battery pretty fast.* The Windows Phone 8 OS is coming along nicely and although you will miss some apps (waiting impatiently for FlipBoard) I have found that it addresses all my day to day needs. (see notes below)* Speed is awesome and games like Asphalt 8 runs brilliantly.* The ATT version only has 16GB of Memory for Apps and no wireless charger. (Thanks for that). But not the phones fault.* I added a 32GB micro SD Card for extra media.* The camera is awesome. 20MP is more than enough for most users.* Browsing the web on this device is pretty good. The big screen helpsSo, Windows Phone 8. The OS got a bad wrap and although there are still some major issues / missing features it is definitely getting better. The user experience is great and fresh when compared to iOS that despite it's makeover, is pretty stale. Things that I miss are:* VPN support (coming)* Notification center (coming).... not much elseThe app gap is closing fast and if Microsoft does go in the direction that some media outlets are reporting (dropping royalty fees for Windows Phone [unconfirmed]) we should hopefully see an explosion of devices to challenge android.Since the OS will only get better, I'm happy with my purchase.","2014-01-03",1

But I can tell you that these two devices are worlds apart. The Moto G is fast and responsive. The WiFi flies. Apps install in a fraction of the time. The battery... damn! Out of the box there was 21% battery and I installed the 4.4 update, downloaded and installed almost all of my apps, setup home screens, signed into apps and configured apps over the course of two plus hours. I plugged it in at 12% battery. I can't wait to see what tomorrow brings.Ask me anything about my experience with this phone.Edit: If you are using this phone with a Net10 type of service, make sure that you input the correct APN settings.

I really like HTC in general. In my opinion they make a great phone. The camera has the ability to focus on objects which is nice to make them clearer when taking pictures. The sound is great, I can hear people clearly when talking on the phone, it's all just great. My husband is with Verizon and has the original version of the HTC One. His is much bigger than this one but I like the smaller phone. His phone has a better camera and some extra bells and whistles but I would say that overall this phone is really great, especially for a prepaid version of a phone.","2014-01-05",1

"166599","Best android device next to my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 inch i Have tried","crazedz","R2GOKZALBZGXHM","As posted in my subject header this is the best next to My Note10.1 inch I have used an that includes my galaxy tab 3 7 inch which in spite of it's faster cpu and more memory still lacks the extra cores which more than make up for its lack of memory. Of course that could be because I also used the 64gb Sandisk sdx card to go with it.  Get it despite the extra 4gigs of memory on the phone you will need extra memory and the sandisk is the best bar none you wont regret it. and will quickly need it anyway so just get it already! Its a great android device trust me I have used a dozen at least going back to icecream sandwich OS.  Google likes using sugary names for their OS's like Apple like's using cats for theirs. Be that as it may the jellybean os on this phone is very nice and the best of all the android os's you will come across to date.  Looking past the OS this phone works with AT&T; phone sims as well as the Tablet sims and yes their is a difference. The phone sims allow for data as well as phone calling features but cost more whereas the tablet sims allow data only features but can support phone calling features through other apps avalible on the android app store like talkatone, talkfree etc. just do a search for phone apps they will pop up. But the native phone system is still better over all. I have looked at other android devices before that just don't work with US carriers but this one does work with at least AT&T; cell and tablet sims. Plus its smoken fast being quad core. The Blu phones just seam to work especially with At&t.;","2014-01-21",1

"143942","Love this phone","S. Roberts","R2IL5U65YLP80W","I have spent the past few years buying different phones, trying to find the right one, there are always problems with them. Well this one is the closest to just right as I can find. Everything is real straight forward, easy to set up. I have had difficult phones and have met the challenge, so I have nothing more to prove, easy is fine for me now. I can customize the colors every day, set on-screen shortcuts, set alarms and reminders. The texting screen is great, the right size and placement of keys for my thumbs. The phone itself is comfortable to hold. The camera, a very important feature for me, takes great pictures, even indoors. As with everything, turning the flash on and off is one tap.I guess there are still a couple CONS...1. The delay on the camera is too long to take some shots.2. As far as I can tell, I can not get or send photos within text messages.Other than that, this phone has everything I need. It is my second Nokia Lumia and I still like it. I just bought my daughter one too.","2014-01-03",1

The screen is very vibrant and clear, it also is so sensitive that you can use gloves. The phone is thin and light also and the camera bump does not get in the way of holding it and is actually does not go out that far.

"169946","Awesome Product!","Ted Williams","R12ZCWXYUY8AUM","I have upgraded my phone from Note 2 to Note 3. This phone has just about everything that I've been looking for in a smartphone! From specifications to quality build, this phone is definitely worth the price they're asking for!With the Note 3, you will notice that the phone performs much faster and more smoothly than the Note 2. That's because the phone currently has one of the most powerful processors in the market boasting a huge 2.3 GHz Quad-Core processor (2nd fastest being the LG G2 at 2.26 GHz Quad-Core). This phone also has 3GB of RAM and the phone also comes with Snapdragon 800 and it comes with Android 4.3 Jellybean.The camera has also been upgraded from the Note 2. It now comes equipped with a 13.0 MP lens for the back and has a 2.0 MP for the front. The picture quality on this phone is amazing for a phone! Whether you want to use it in a bright setting or a dark setting, the camera captures it all. Keep in mind that although the camera isn't Canon or Nikon quality, it also isn't terrible neither!The Galaxy phones are also the only phones on the current market where you are able to remove and/or change the battery. This is a huge plus if your phone freezes or if your battery can no longer hold a charge and you can't afford to go a day without it.This phone already comes with 32GB of memory already built into it! You still think 32GB is not enough? This phone has the option of adding more memory into it if you need the extra amount! These phones can read memory cards up to 64GB which means that you can put as much as 96GB of storage on your phone if you wanted to!","2014-01-13",1

"175841","Amazing Phone, Amazing Price","Nella","R119X45OZX84BB","I got this phone as a replacement for my Motorola Defy, I was thinking about getting another motorola from the start. Then Motorola anounced this one. I was surprised at first by the spcs you get by the price so i decided to go for this one.At first, when i Got it the box was really small, so it was a bit misleading due to the size of the actual phone, which is decently big, next i was surprised by the network speeds i got with it, Usually i got like 2 or 3mbps tops on my old phone, with this one i topped at 9mbps which is amazing.I Got the 16GB version due to the lack of an External SD Card, which is no biggie since i noticedd i didn't actually need it since i Use a lot of cloud sevices like Google Play Music and Spotify and the likes.Camera at the beginnig was a bit lacky, i got the Kitkat update and then i proceeded to root and install Android Tweaker 2 in order to get the Bravia Engine 3 running on my phone, i do believe that it boosted the image quality, which, after the update, wasn't that bad.It was bigger that i expected for some reason, but I definetly Like it.","2014-01-09",1

(Straight talk is also awesome at 45$ a month)The phone is fast, smooth and doesn't everything you need. It's as simple as that. I don't need a phone to change my tv channel(GS4). I have no issues with its look, I ready its boring..not my thought.

"151313","A steal","Andrey","R30R5ZHSWG8VA2","Could be perfect phone depending on your needs. I use this as a personal media device, GPS recorder, backup camera, and GPS navigator. I haven't used the phone features yet so I will not be reviewing those.Hardware:For being the lowest-end Lumia model, the user experience is surprisingly fluid. My 3yo Android Captivate kept frustrating me by struggling to respond to my input, but the 520 responds almost instantly and there's no lag in the animations - it's a pleasure to use.Not a single issue with the GPS, it's worked every single time so far (I've been using it to record my bike commutes and hikes). Love that I can hold the camera button and go into the camera without fumbling with the screen - even if I have gloves on, that's a big win right there. The image quality is so-so, you won't be printing any of these, but I didn't expect anything great. However, the best camera is the one you have with you, and this one does work for capturing a moment and sharing it with friends/family.Software:Huge, huge nod to Nokia Maps. The device is worth the money just for this functionality alone. Free offline maps? Hell yes! OK, the maps may not be as detailed as Google's or OpenStreetMap's, but they do have POIs and they still work - and the Drive app works BETTER than a standalone Garmin unit I have (rant: why can't Garmin, in this day and age, fix their damn POI search algorithm - it never works!). The directions the Drive app gives are excellent, I have even been using it without looking at the screen, and it always gives timely, clear directions.Nokia Transit is also great for finding bus and train routes, and Nokia Radio is a nice little bonus, though the sound quality could be better. The default music player app is a little lacking in usability, so it takes away from using this device as a music player (but I haven't tried any 3rd-party apps yet). Sound quality is just fine.The email app is easy to use and the keyboard is not intrusive as it can sometimes be on Android. In fact, I prefer checking my email on my Windows device now, it feels a bit more business-oriented.I won't be reviewing the Windows Phone OS in great detail (yeah, not as many apps), but I'll just mention that having experience with Android and iOS, I like the live tiles better than having icons all over the screen - though I probably would want to group the tiles by folders.Overall, this phone is great as an entry-level Windows device, and definitely got me interested in a more serious Lumia with a better camera. I haven't tried and don't think I would want to be gaming on this particular model, but I don't see why you can't play basic games.","2014-01-21",1

"175856","Affordable but not cheap","Evangel Biason","R3N59EK8AKO3J0","For the budget conscious, the Moto G delivers an affordable smartphone that performs. It's quadcore Snapdragon processor delivers enough power to motor through day to day applications. It also delivers a very pure android KitKat experience by stripping out the flashy features that may be impractical for daily use and focuses on features that matter such as a amazing battery life and a sharp 4.5 1280 x 720 HD display.It does have its limitations, namely it's 5MP camera that is quite mediocre in contrast to the phone's other hardware specs. It aslo lacks the microSD expansion slot, but again for day to day use, the 16GB version suffices. Google is also offering 50GB of Google Drive space for Moto G owners who need more than the stock internal memory.Moto G also feels comfortable to hold. Minus the overly protruding volume and power buttons, the phone is quite sleek with clean lines.Bottom line, the Moto G blows away all the smartphones in it's price range and would even challenge phones twice its price.","2014-01-02",1

Does not have the super-duper camera of the top-of-the-line, but takes very acceptable photos. It supports all the other features (NFC, City Lens, Compass, etc.), not found on the basic Nokia phones.Call quality is very clear and loud when listening and I have people remark that it sounds very good on the other end as well. Battery life is pretty good. I normally remember to charge it during the day at work; but when I haven't, I still can go more than a day on a charge (although, I mostly use if for phone/checking email, and a little web lookup)Only real problem is availability, for some reason, Nokia only made these for a very short period of time, but they still can be found new.","2014-01-21",1

Nokia has always made solid hardware and the Windows phone platform will catch up quickly to iOS and Android.  The app store is inferior, but give it time and every major app will be offered on Windows Phones before time.  There's already versions of Instragram, snapchat, whatsapp, etc. if that's your thing.  As far as the phone goes, again for the money, this phone is great.  The OS is easy, I actually like the tiles and ability to customize it.  Good call clarity, messaging, fast internet, and best of all FREE MAPS - offline, meaning do data is used.  The only downsides would be no flash on camera or front facing camera either, but it does take decent pictures outside or in lighted areas.","2014-01-21",1

"168570","Only $10! What?!","Kushal Joshi","R18BALM1V0H15K","12/21/13 Update:So about 2 weeks ago Nexus 5 users received the 4.4.2 update, it brought many small improvements but the greatest being improving the camera. It shoots very clear shots now, the camera app opens quicker and the camera takes a lot less time to focus. If the camera was something that turned you away from the Nexus 5, then come back because the issue has been fixed. Google says they will keep working on the camera to make it even better.(Stay tuned for any other updates)Original Review:I sold my S3 to get this phone on the Google Play Store and I recommend you do as well (It costs less on the Google Play Store)[...] The total ends up being less than $400 for a smart phone that is priced way to low for what it has to offer.Pricing:$350- 16 GB$400- 32 GBA Snapdragon 800 Quad-Core Processor clocked at 2.3 Ghz? A Adreno 330 GPU, all these sound to good to be true! Such great specifications at such a low price? But, nothing matters if there is no applicable real world performance, and I'm glad to say that you will be zipping through games and apps!Here are some Pros and Cons:Pros:-Phone feels great in the hand, not to big or not to small-Great Build Quality, better than phones that use plastic like the LG-G2 or S4 (It uses the grippy plastic found on the 2013 Nexus 5)-Buttery Smooth and Fast as Lightning, this phone is that fastest phone I have ever used, hands down-Pure Stock Android (Kit-Kat 4.4)-You get updates as soon as they roll out! No waiting for months to get the next version of androidCons:-Because it only packs a 2300 mh battery, it does ok for daily use, but don't expect to get any crazy battery life, (Standby time is amazing though, it sipped through only a 1% of battery through the whole night!)-Camera is decent, but video quality is great! The mic is the best I have seen on any smart phone, (A software update may improve camera)-Availability, I love this phone, but getting your hands on one can take a bit, but please believe me, it is worth the wait!-Speaker is just all right, it sounds OK but not greatTotal Scores:Build Quality: 9/10User Experience: 10/10Android Kit-Kat (Nexus 5 Experience): 10/10Camera (Photos): 7/10Camera (Video): 9/10Speaker: 7/10Summery:If you looking for a phone that delivers the best Android Experience, a cheap off contract phone, a phone with great specifications, or just a phone in general, This is the best phone currently on the market. While it has some minor flaws, there is no other phone that offers this much for this little.Total Score:9/10","2014-01-01",1

Kept my GSM service (a must where I live) and can still hit the 3G data network as well.  The 5  screen is clear and the HD screen is vivid. It only has 4 gig of memory but with the expansion slot it isn't an issue. In fact I  can load all the apps I regularly use on the phone. Unless you want to save tons of video you won't  miss the memory.  Video play back is great. I've streamed Netflix a few times with no buffering.

"72401","Warning! i9250 is the GSM version!","David","R2Q5RVKQE2IZZ4","The version I bought was the international Galaxy Nexus, i9250. It is the version that can be easily converted between software versions using the Factory Images available on the Android site.In short, this is a great device. It does not have the best construction quality (noticeable, rough edges at one side of the front), it's a Samsung after all, but when it launched it had everything, including an HD screen with a resolution that, even today (feb 2014), the iPhone can't match. The PenTile arrangement didn't bother me at all, and images were crisp enough. Of course they were not as crisp as a full RGB HD, but it was better than what other phones had to offer in the OLED camp. That said, the OLED at that resolution was marvelous to look at (today we are spoiled by 1080p screens), especially because the unmatched contrast made possible by black pixels that actually are black when black. :)Burn out of the blue pixels still are not a pronounced issue. You can't normally notice, only under specific backgrounds. It is much, much less than the Nexus S I had before it, and most of it is also transitory (disappears after a few seconds). Some of it is permanent, however. As I said, it does not bother me even today.More than 2 years later, I'm moving towards a Nexus 5, but this phone is still impressive and can handle basically all apps except those that need graphics performance (like games). Also, this phone received the last official update last year, so it won't have (officially, at least) Android 4.4/KitKat. However, regarding compatibility, you shouldn't have problems for a long time. Since Android 4.3/Jelly Bean already had major components that apps use in a daily-basis, this isn't, by any means, a compatibility problem anywhere near the break that 3.0;3.2/Honeycomb and 4.0/Ice Cream Sandwich were. The performance is also decent even today: on a daily basis, it is smoother than many higher end phones that were launched after the Galaxy Nexus. The fact that the Nexus line software is slim, not bloated, also helps.I don't think anyone should buy it (a 2.5 years old model after all) for this price (there are many better devices much cheaper). A bit more and you can get a Nexus 5. Some less and you can get midrange devices released recently that are much better than the Galaxy Nexus.","2014-02-03",1
"174496","best phone i ever had","abhishek agarwal","R9PK7FM25PIGV","I got the 16GB global GSM version direct from Motorola instead of Amazon as they were shipping faster but here it goes anyway. The phone feels well built, of quality materials and it handles well (can almost be use one-handed). I would have preferred the power button on top but it still better than having it on the left.Pros- good quadcore processor handles tasks easily given the 1GB of RAM- not much fluff on top of Android4.3 and guaranteed update to 4.4- good looking screen with vibrant colors and great resolution/DPI- built-in FM radio (yes, I'm old-fashioned but it was a must for me)- camera is decent for a phone- LED is powerful enough and makes a good spot for using as flashlight- built in compass is fairly precise and does not jump around muchCons- no SD card (this is more of a fault to me since I like to put loads of music on my phone and thus only 4 star rating. You get ~12GB free with the 16GB version)- no 4G (I get 8Mbits/second in San Jose, CA using 3G though which is sufficient to watch Neflix without a hitch)Edit1: despite what the description says in San Jose, CA using T-mobile prepaid I am not limited to 2G service.

The phone is awesome and I used for few days with my friend. The battery with all of the speech recongition is great as it has two chips.  This is really the next generation in user interface. The specs in a nutshell are:Motorola Moto G: 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 in, 143 gm, 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.5 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 5 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 1.17 W/kg (head), 1.06 W/kg (body)In my opinion, these are key specs to consider. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR  (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers don’t advertize or mention SAR prominently.Some of the other competing phones in this segment are follows and use them if you are shopping around!Samsung Galaxy S4 (Intl version):  5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD, up to 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU, Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 0.85 W/kg (head), 1.55 W/kg (body)LG G2: 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.2 in, 424 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 13 MP/2.1 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.26 GHz Krait 400, 0.50 W/kg (head), 0.69 W/kg (body)HTC One: 5.41 x 2.69 x 0.37 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.7 in, 469 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 4 MP/2.1MP, Qualcomm APQ8064T Snapdragon 600, Quad-core 1.7 GHz Krait 300, 0.66 W/kg (head), 0.40 W/kg (body)Google Nexus 5: 5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.95 in, 445 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 8 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400, 0.92 W/kg (head), 1.23 W/kg (body)Apple iPhone 5S: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 in, 112gm, 640 x 1136 pixels, 4.0 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 8 MP/1.2 MP, Apple A7, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based), 1.12 W/kg (head), 1.18 W/kg (body)Nokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP,  Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU  Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)","2014-02-21",1

It's got all the power that you need for any random apps with its dual core processor, and in my opinion it's the perfect size.  Smartphones have been getting ridiculously clunky to fit in your pocket, this one is small, feels good in your hand, and has a nice density to it that makes you think of luxury.The on thing is that it's really slippery without a cover, like ridiculously slippery.  I got really annoyed at this until I bought a case and realized that I was an idiot and should have done that a long time ago.  Now I just think of the slipperyness as an added incentive to buy a case to protect your phone.So yeah, all in all it's an awesome phone and for 80$ it's a straight up steal.

"180959","Lives up to it's Icon name!","Kimberly Gregg","R2293UT69KKIQ","I have had several phones over the years from Motorola to HTC and Samsung. This phone is by far the most amazing and fun device I have ever owned. After I set it up it just feels alive! ALL other phones I have used were static and feel boring by comparison, I shopped around for my new phone for several months and decided on the Nokia Icon.Physically, the fit and finish is the best I have ever used. The buttons are nice and the travel on them is as close to perfect as I can imagine. I had to see the screen to appreciate it. The colors pop like nothing else I've seen in a mobile device. Although the phone is similar in physical size to other phones with 4-4.5 screens this one is 5 and goes from edge to edge. The phone has built-in wireless charging, NFC and no camera bump. Unlike the iPhone I can talk and use the internet at the same time on Verizon.The primary function I use my phone for besides calls and texting is picture-taking. The 20mp camera is nothing short of jaw-dropping. The images are extremely detailed and the best I have ever seen. Nokia has really spent a lot of time and effort making the camera great. They also created several apps to do cool things with the images. Refocus allows me to decide what I want in focus after shooting the picture. Cinemagraph allows animation in the picture while the rest remains static.There are some of the most innovative and useful apps exclusive to this platform. Photobeamer allows me to share the pictures from my phone with anyone's computer screen. Nokia Beamer allows me to share my phone's screen with anyone, anywhere on their computer. HERE Drive+ has complete offline maps so I don't use ANY data! HERE Maps with LiveSight is totally awesome. When I turn the phone vertically to look down the street, it superimposes the businesses so I see businesses. The images are links to their websites, menus, reviews, etc. DataSense minimizes data which saves $ and allowed me a smaller data plan. Wallet is built-in and seamless for purchases.Windows Phone comes with Kid's Corner built-in. I have 4 children who always want to play games on my phone including Flappy Bird, Angry Birds and whatever else is out there. This allows them to use it without fear of messing up anything up I have control of what they can access to anything I don't want them using.If you are considering something new, different, and innovative... this is a phone worth checking out!","2014-02-28",1

"174266","Best Phone For The Price!!","Cableguy","R12MXMY4U3T4DY","I have owned the iPhone 5c, Samsung Galaxy S3, S4 and more.  I sold my S4 because I didn't like the size and bulk of the phone.  I started looking for a phone that was the size of an iPhone, that was android, and that had a decent camera.  After many videos and tons of research, I found the Moto G. Moto x is better but double the price and Nexus 5 was too big for meThe camera.. after many reviews of this phone, the downside was the the camera, but for $200 bucks why not try it.  The camera is great!! I don't know what people are doing, but all my pics turn out as good as my old iPhone 5c. The only problem is low light videos,and pics then you get unclear photos, but thats it! Outdoor shots taken with my wife's 5s are a little better but not by much,but there are only a few camera phones that look good in low light and they cost triple the price of this.The phone is super fast!  I have done everything on this phone that you can and never ran into any lag or reboots. I would say just as fast as an iPhone 5 a little slower than Galaxy s4 when you update to KITKATThe phone itself looks larger on videos that I watched on youtube, but It's not!  It is almost the same size as my wife's iPhone 5s with the display almost identical! Gorgeous display!The phone is super slippery, so I ordered the grip case from Motorola to help with that.This phone rocks! for under $200 , there is nothing that can beat it!  I compare it to an iPhone 5c but with a fm radio  and larger screenPros. Amazing Display. Awesome Battery Life. Super Fast. Great Camera. Perfect size for hand. FREE 50 gig of storage Google Drive. Feels like a $500 phone. KitkatCons. Super slipper shell. One colored Led notification. No sd card slot. No removable batteryStill can't believe this is under $200","2014-02-15",1

"176128","Best 200$ I've spent on a phone","Brianna","R1M46SZWGN367R","I've owned a lot of phones. From VZW: Moto Droid 2, Moto Droid X, HTC Incredible, HTC Incredible 2, iPhone 4, iPhone 4s, iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, Galaxy s4, Galaxy s3, and many others.I was looking for an unlocked device to use on the h2o (AT&T;) network, with minimal bloatwear and newest android updates quick. This is working perfectly. Basically a nexus device for close to half the price.10/10 The radio gets a tad better reception at my desk than my s4/s3's did.8/10 The camera isn't as good as the s4 but close to the s3 for quality.10/10 The flavor of android is clean and free of motoblur or samsungs touchwiz ensuring faster updates as new versions of android are released. The software motorola added is amazing. They include 2 apps, one for migrating which created a private area wifi network and transferred all of my texts, pictures, and videos. Another which is a contextual aware app that you can set if this then else actions. Very cool stuff.10/10 The chassis hardware is fantastic think build quality of iphone or htc one. Feels quality, not cheap plastic.Would buy again. Am recommending it to friends and family.","2014-02-11",1

"174474","Longest Battery Life Ever!","Sarah I Brown","RV7UIZYOQ3T23","I admit I was a bit hesitant buying this phone even though reviews were great. Everyone one wants the newest, flashiest, most expensive piece of technology out there & I wasn't sure I wanted to give that up. But I'm tired of paying a ton of money for extra features I forget are there or don't care to use. So, for the low price of $200 I bought something that suits me perfectly & didn't take to big of a chunk out of my wallet. The best feature, because it's 3G instead of 4G data my battery life is like the energizer bunny it keeps going & going. I have never had less than half my battery life at the end of the day & I am on apps & the internet a lot. Plus, everything runs fast & smoothly, there has been no annoying lag. The biggest down side is the camera is not as good which would be nice. But I have never been big on photos from my phone.

"175404","Excellent phone","Afzal Hossain","R3KI754XPXEAZB","I waited for few weeks till I decided to go for Moto G as I was undecided between Moto G/X,and Nexus 5. I read as many review as possible and finally decided to give Moto G a shot considering it is the cheapest among the three I have in my mind. My biggest worry about Moto G was that it comes with 3G where as the other two are 4G. My justification to go for Moto G (US GSM, 16GB) was that I do not use internet in my phone that much (mostly navigation, weather, reading, audio streaming, occasional Youtube and absolutely no game). To my surprise, 3G proved to be perfect for my need. Nevertheless, I checked the 3G speed (Queens, NY/ T-Mobile network) and I got download speed between 8-11 Mbps.Pros:1. Good call quality.2. Outstanding battery life. With wi-fi turned on for 50% of the time, and some average use (lots of software download/update, an hour of phone conversation), the battery lasted around 40 hrs.3. Free update to Kitkat is just awesome.Cons:1. No expandable memory (I find it hard to understand why a phone cannot have expandable memory).2. Several interface related aspects (Call, Contacts etc). A matter of personal taste, I presume.I would recommend this product to anyone.","2014-02-03",1

"156731","You bet!","Laoblue","R2HIFMUXBHEGS5","Great phone!  Has a solid feel with metal-like, firm edges that don't cut into your palm like to older version.  Speaker is on the bottom, so audio is clear - unlike the older version.  The camera iawry ally good for a phone!  Once you get to know all the functions, you will be impressed!  Close-up shots are the best though.  Landscape shots suffer a little in detail when blown-up, and there is some purpling with the sunshine - maybe because of the small lense.  Great screen too, any bigger would be a pad, with vivid colors and fantastic detail.Ok, all the great things....the no-so-great...is the battery, but I don't play lots of games or watch movies, so no problem.  It wont last long if you are a heavy gamer in between texting or calls.  And come on, this is a thin phone, what can you really hope to get out of the thin battery?  Yeah, the phone is a little heavy and bulky, especially for a gal, I would think.  Also, like other phones, it can get warm to the touch after playing games, or operating the camera for a while - a nice hand warmer maybe.","2014-02-02",1

"57467","Best feature phone ever-- best features, best reliability, longest battery life; I've owned THREE (all are still perfect!)","Allen Jackson","R3Q90RST7BNVSK","This phone is simply the best feature phone ever, certainly at Sprint.I've owned three (over 4 years), simply because every time I was entitled to a free upgrade, I always chose THIS phone, after loving the first one. It has the best keyboard to type on for large fingers (with 4 rows, the top row with just numerals), the email works amazingly well, texting is simple, fast, and 100% reliable, the battery life is an exceptionally long 7 hours on one charge (per Sprint, but over 8 hours per my own experience), the call quality is crystal-clear (both to the caller and to those on the other end), 3-way calls are a breeze, and the camera is excellent. In fact, no one ever knows I'm using the speaker phone, as that feature also sounds crystal-clear to those I'm speaking with (I used to ask the person on the other end how well I sounded, all the time, and they'd always say, perfect, whether I was using the speakerphone, blue-tooth, a headset, or via the normal earpiece/microphone!).This phone is highly reviewed on the Sprint website, by hundreds of customers (one of the reasons I first bought it)-- and most of the (few) poor reviews there (and on other websites) were from people who bought it USED--and then only Good, yet they then somehow blame LG or the phone for its arriving in beat-up condition and things not working. Hey, folks, somebody sold you broken and damaged phones . . . and why would you ever buy a cell phone in less than New or Like-New condition, anyway?? (Many people really abuse their cell phones-- they use their phones in the rain and they drop them, and their kids break them . . . or does this not occur to you?)Anyway, ALL three of my Sprint LG Rumor Touch (LN510) phones work perfectly in all respects to this day. And I never would have opened and activated the 2nd and 3rd (which I did only to see that they worked fine upon purchase), because #1 is still working perfectly and even still LOOKS brand-new and shiny. Basically, for the main functions on a phone-- crystal-clear calling, texting, email, a great keyboard, and long battery life-- this phone simply does them better than other feature/basic phones, and better than most SMART phones, too (I've owned an i-Phone and two Androids). Calls on this phone are crystal clear; texting works perfectly-- always, both sending and receiving-- and the physical (QWERTY) keyboard has the best touch and most easily visible letters/numbers (in ANY light), plus has FOUR rows (the top one with just numerals); and the Internet, at 3G speed, works well, though not as fast as 4G.You also get the benefit of paying the lowest monthly fee on Sprint calling plans (and lowest monthly data fee), since it's a basic phone and not a smart phone. But, it does almost everything a smart phone does, almost always better, except efficiently running apps, many of which it cannot use at all. It DOES download music, ringers, and it streams video and music. I read the news (CBS, ABC, CNN, Yahoo!, etc.) on this phone daily. You can text to one person or CC up to 40 people at a time with one text. You receive whisper alerts-- one line of text, highlighted in white, when you receive a text message while you're on a call (you can turn off this feature, but why?), and the Call Waiting, 3-Way Calling, and Call Forwarding functions work perfectly and easily. The phone book--the Contacts--works perfectly--you press for a second to make a letter appear, and then can scroll IMMEDIATELY to the letter of the alphabet you need to look up your particular contact-- whereas even many smart phones today make you scroll through ALL of your hundreds of contacts, which would take forever. Not with this phone, this is far better.Speaking of contacts, this phone works perfectly with Sprint's Wireless Backup system, which let's you load 600 names, each with up to 6 phone numbers plus an email address. When you add, delete, or change an entry to your Contacts on this phone, it backs up, accurately, to Sprint's servers, within seconds, and then notifies you of such (you can turn off the notification feature). And you can go online to Sprint's Wireless Backup website to add, delete, or modify phone numbers and other info there; it then backs up those changes to your phone. Again, within 60 seconds, usually within 30 seconds-- and notifies you that it did. So, if you ever lose or break your phone, when you get another one, all of your contacts will load to the new one perfectly within a few minutes of activation. Oddly, all of Sprint's newer feature phones (ALL brands) do NOT have this feature, including the two that replaced this very model. But, this one, the LG Rumor Touch, has it. An invaluable feature. Why risk ever losing all your contacts when you don't have to?Brand-new, this phone comes with the battery, wall charger, a micro-SD card, a holder for the micro-SD card, an instruction manual, and plastic bag to return old phones for recycling if desired. This phone is FAR superior to its two successors, the LG Rumor Reflex and the LG Rumor Reflex S-- it has better-working email by far (works perfectly), FAR longer battery life, a better touch-screen, a FAR-better QWERTY [manual] keyboard, it's the only model of the three that 1) comes with a micro-SD card, and 2) works with Sprint's Wireless Backup of contacts. Oddly, the two successor phones have email functionality that is FAR inferior to use (email works illogically on those two--you actually have to BACK OUT of your Inbox to refresh it!?-- and it takes much more time to view or send an email; whereas all of that on THIS phone is smooth, logical, and fast). Oddly as well, many have complained on Sprint's website (about the other 2 phones) about something I noticed, too, on those two successor models: their keyboards are not visible under certain light--they're o.k. in bright light or darkness, but the letters/numbers are almost invisible at dusk. NOT a problem at all with THIS model, the Rumor Touch-- the physical keyboard is easily viewable (ALL keys) under ALL lighting conditions, as is the touch screen (though the touch screen, like all phone screens, is a challenge to view easily in bright sunlight).The phone's blue-tooth function works perfectly, and allows you to connect up to 8 or so different blue-tooth devices to it. And it has a headset jack for the use of a headset-- again, which makes the calls sound crystal clear to both you and to the person you're speaking with; I've tested this. Music sounds wonderful via headset as well.The only possible negative for this phone? Barely a negative: the touch screen, while very good, isn't as high-tech as those on much more expensive smart phones. It still works wonderfully and in no way seems cheap; but it's the only thing on this otherwise premier, luxurious phone that isn't truly luxurious. It's good, though!This is the BEST Sprint feature/non-smart phone ever! Excellent phone calls, emailing, and texting. Plus LONG battery life (7 hours talk on one charge, per the Sprint website and my own testing of it that gave over 8 hours talk on one charge). Also has excellent functionality in music, video, downloaded ringers, social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), and more. It's a fast 3G phone for Internet use.MOST HIGHLY recommended.","2014-02-09",1

"170870","Great phone.  Motorola hit the spot","Roman","R2KKH52J5MHGW1","I think this is great smartphone which delivers high end features at price of budget phone.I think Motorola packed perfect features into this device for more than reasonable price.It also fits the biggest needs of every average android phone user.-As of now (feb.  2014) there are absolutely no competition for this phone at this price point.  It's simple as that,  there are no KitKat phones at this price point.  There are no phones with such a good screen at this price point. No other smartphone has a comparable battery life at this price.  And in fact it has better specs and features than some $300 phones.-4.5 ideal screen size that makes it not to big or too small and easy on most user's eyes.  300+ppi is ideal density,  because eye can no longer trace pixels on the screen.-battery life is great (around 5hr of screen time,  it might vary on use but its better than most phones) and its one of the important factor in smartphones-very quick and responsive.  Screen is very responsive to touches which makes it very easy to type fast.  Browsing around phone has no lag or delays.  Apps load fast.-OS might be unimportant to 90% of users,  but KitKat is what makes this phone so good.-Ok camera.  I would really love to buy a high end phone without 20mp camera just to save a few bucks.  And thats why moto g has an average camera,  because it's not the most important feature of the phone and it could be easily replaced with 5mp camera whithout too many users even noticing.  Nokia with 41mp camera has an insane price exactly for that reason,  mean while  rest of whone spects is nothing special for the price.-Micro SD slot is a handy feature,  but few free gigabytes on the phone is OK for most.  My guess would be it's most important feature for kids,  teenagers and early young adults because of all the music and games they need.  So again,  you can have a few big games and 100 songs in  8gb version and still have some space left.","2014-02-16",1

I had the phone a month when my 2-year-old threw it in the pool.  I immediately took it apart and my husband put it in the dryer on a sweater rack.  I am still using the phone almost a year later!  I bought a second phone just like it for my husband to use.  This time my 2-year-old jumped in the pool without his water wings (I was standing right beside him, fully clothed with my phone in my pocket)...of course, I jumped right in and got him out.  AGAIN, I immediately took the phone apart and put it in the dryer on a sweater rack...the phone still worked.  THEN, my husband put the phone on the bumper of his truck and drove over top of it...the phone still worked!...the screen was cracked and you couldn't see much of what you were typing, but the phone still worked...and the screen worked too!

Works perfectly here in Venezuela.On october 2013, I bought a Nexus 4 and I just can't see the difference. Au contraire, it seems that the Moto G uses way less battery (I charged it when I got it almost 48H ago and has still 40% power) and definitly gets less warm when I use it.The upgrade to android 4.4.2 kitkat was quick and easy. The phone is really well build. When I took the rear protection off, I figured the speaker was really protected against dust and everything seemed perfectly sealed.Some people reported having issues with the rear protection but I succeded in opening it very quickly with short nails.I will edit my comment later, but it works very very good for me.-----------------------El celular funciona de maravilla en Venezuela. Todo en orden, 3G y todo. Les recomiendo comprar protectores tambien porque aquí nadie tiene accesorios así que mosca. Lo recibí el jueves, lo cargué enseguida y hoy sábado aún tiene 40% de batería a pesar de usar el wifi y llamar más o menos 30min (acumulado). No calienta como el nexus 4 que me robaron hace unas semanas. y por cierto, me encanta el tamaño del celular ya que cabe perfectamente en la mano y en el bolsillo.

I haven't used the camera enough times to form an opinion but few pictures taken aren't bad.Initially, it was not doing 3G when I inserted my SIM. This made me to google the problem on the net which led me to doing a factory reset. However, I was to eventually find out that my service provider had suspended 3G on my SIM. The moment this was activated, the phone became a delight as mobile data and hotspot became fast. Also, the factory reset was so seamless with all the apps I had installed in the short time of owning this phone reinstalled back.

"149848","great phone","Jason W.","RAC2PDVIN3HLF","i've owned this phone for more than 6 months now... and so far, it has exceeded all my expectations. coming from a $200 phone, this has been a significant improvement in every way.the good :first of all, i find this phone a great size. the screen is about 20% bigger than the phone it is replacing, but the body of the GT-i9192 is slim enough that, even with a case, it is actually more thin than my previous phone. fits in my pocket, and is nice and light.the phone is mostly made of plastics, so the whole thing is a bit slick for my fingers (another reason for the case), but it does seem to be fine quality... there has been no unexpected wear or anything getting loose or showing any signs of coming apart after 6 months of heavy daily use. i've dropped it twice from pocket height, and there has been no apparent damage (i use a Hyperion case http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CXMWV1O ).as it says in the description, this is an unlocked GSM phone. i have so-far used it in Russia, Ukraine, Greece, France, the UK, Turkey, and India. all with no problems. i work out of Moscow, so all of these travels have just been using a local carrier (MTC) SIM card. the phone gets very good reception, and i haven't had any issues with dropping calls.the battery life is really impressive. with moderate use, i can expect the phone to last 2 days between charges. with heavier use (including internet and listening to music) the phone easily lasts the entire work day.... from 7am to about 11pm. if i know i won't have power available for a while, the phone can be miserly if you turn off all extra features and only use it for texting.the camera is great. i haven't made any prints, but even on my computer most of the pictures look great. the phone is an easy replacement for a cheap point-and-shoot camera. the flash is somewhat helpful for pictures... i am most impressed that the flash can apparently be adjusted automatically by the phone, so that there's at least some chance of the picture not being washed out. the video recording is also quite good. you can actually turn on the flash, using the assistance light toggle (what a ridiculous name), and then turn on the video camera.i don't play games on the phone, so i can't vouch for that kind of performance... but it has handled browsing the internet, 3rd party GPS apps, network utilities, viewing .PDF files, and watching movies, all nicely and quickly. i've only had an app crash and reboot the phone once or twice.i have noticed the phone gets quite warm when using it as a WIFI hub for other devices. for several months the GT-i9192 was my only broadband option, i would use the phone as the WIFI hub for my laptop. when i removed the phone from it's rubber case the heat problem was eliminated. if the phone is within 6 feet of connected devices, the internet speed is perfectly acceptable for browsing and email, i cannot say if it would work for streaming videos.the speaker is quite good. i don't use the speaker phone feature often, but i do use the phone to listen to music quite regularly. at a reasonable volume it sounds fine. you have to have reasonable expectations for a little tiny speaker in a phone, but at a moderate volume, it sounds perfectly OK for a little background music.the bad :up until a software update (automatically pushed by Samsung) i could not get the aGPS to work at ALL on this phone. i downloaded several different utilities and tried all the steps like clearing the cache and downloading new coordinates, etc etc etc. simply put... nothing helped. i was almost to the point of contacting Samsung about returning the phone, after having found plenty of complaints about defective aGPS on this model.last month the update pushed through, and seems to have fixed the aGPS problem. it will still take a long time to grab the satellites if i am inside any kind of building. but if i am outside it will get a fix in under a minute. i do notice that occasionally the phone will refuse to fix any satellites until i use a utility (GPS Status) to clear the cache and then reboot the phone. then it will work fine for several days.the phone wants to be your nanny and it is a chore to turn the volume up when listening to music. i use this phone as an MP3 player at the gym. and any time i want to turn the volume up beyond half way, i have to acknowledge that i might be making myself deaf.the auto-correct is HORRIBLE. to be fair, this may be entirely the fault of android. but coming from my old phone, whatever version of android was around 2 years ago, this auto-correct is the worst thing to have happened. if i want to add a word to the dictionary i have to click the word once, and THEN, click the word AGAIN after hitting space or whatever punctuation mark i wanted to use. i don't know if it's saving the word into two different dictionaries or what. apparently there is no way of actually seeing or controlling what is going on with the dictionaries, either. this sounds like a small complaint, but it still is a really chaffing issue for me. the only thing that is worse than the auto-correct is my spelling when i turn it off.i HATE that this phone has a USB micro-B connector for charging/docking. there's almost no point in complaining against progress in the USB family, but the mini-B was a far superior connector. as you are most likely familiar, micro-B is the current standard for android phones, and it offers almost no tactile feedback about orientation until you've fairly well jammed the connector into the phone. at least with the mini-B you could tell right away if you were trying to plug the cable in upside down. every time i try to plug the phone in, in the dark, i have to do it timidly because i don't want to damage the tiny little connector pins inside the mini-B port. everything seems built well enough, but inside the port is a very VERY thin board holding all the connection pins, and i can easily imagine it snapping off. at least it's a standard port, instead of needing any kind of proprietary plug.in conclusion; this phone is great. awesome battery life, awesome camera, the perfect size for my needs, a true dual+active phone. get a case because it's a slippery thing without one, bring back the mini-B USB port!","2014-03-19",1

This phone allowed both my husband and I to get a brand new smartphone for $400 instead of spending $1000+ or having to sign on to 2 year contracts with our provider.  As far as I can tell these phones are every bit as good as my friends and family's phones.  I'm still learning how to use to to the fullest extent, but have used the texting, email, several games and the GPS system and I'm very impressed.  I'm not an expert, but it does everything I want and amazingly well.  I was a little concerned that it only ran on 3G, but it's just as fast as my friend's iphone.  I'm told that it's due to the fact that the Moto G has such a fast operating system...KitKat?  Anyhow, I recommend it -- it has only been 2 weeks so we'll see how it goes from here!","2014-03-01",1

This was a significant feature since she does not use the phone much and this plan gives her service for $8-9/month when paying a year at a time, which is much cheaper than something like Jitterbug or other options we saw.","2014-03-19",1

This phone may not have the highest specs, but don't let that fool you. This phone is very very fast. From loading internet pages to multitasking, it just breezes through it. I have yet to notice any slowdown or lag. The amoled display is amazing also. I haven't done a real test of the battery life, but it easily takes me through my day (about 6 a.m. to 4-5 p.m.) while using it for about 80% of that time. Its great for me. The camera interface is very very simple, some say its too simple, but for me, it gets the job done and quite well in my opinion (after the update, that is. the way the camera pictures turned out, right out of the box, weren't bad, but they seem to be much better after updating).","2014-03-26",1

"185189","The (New)ONE to Rule Them All!","Johnny Saigon®","R29WFI32D0M2CB","I love HTC phones and I have both last year's One(m7) and this year's(m8). I am NOT affiliated with HTC or compensated by them in any way. I just feel that competition and the underdog companies are crucial and essential for a healthy free market economy, and ultimately, us consumers. I have had the iPhones 4 through 5s, Samsung Galaxy S3/S4 and Note 2/3, and several Nokia(n95-97, n84/85 and several lesser phones) and Sony/Sony-Ericsson(Xperia) phones over the years, and I have loved most of them. For a healthy and positive technological evolution, we NEED the small or struggling companies like HTC to succeed. If Apple and Samsung become duopolies, that will be a dark future indeed. Pick up an HTC One(M7 or M8) and any Samsung Galaxy phones and compare the quality and craftsmanship, and tell me why it's Samsung and not HTC that have more successful phones. It's all about the MONEY and marketing, the bigger guy trying to squeeze out the smaller guy, and that's NOT how a healthy free market economy should be.Now that that is out of the way, let us get down to the nitty gritty. This is my direct comparisons to the iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy S4/S5 and Note 3, but mainly to the last HTC One(M7)(and yes, I am mainly updating keypoints from the m7 review):The Good:1) THE SCREEN: If there was such a better screen on a phone, I have not yet seen it. The iPhone 5s is lauded for its excellent screen, but at its current resolution, it trails behind the One's screen by far. Everything just POPS out at you. Even in direct sunlight, everything is CLEAR and BRIGHT. I really loved the 2013 HTC One's(M7) screen, but once again HTC has outdone itself and given us a true masterpiece in 5.0 1080p(440ppi) form. The main difference between the M8 and the M7 is the color reproduction on the M8 is better and more true-to-life. This is THE BEST screen on the planet right now - WOW!!!2) THE DESIGN/HARDWARE: Once again, the new One continues the HTC tradition of making really high-quality phones with high-class material and craftsmanship. This version has more of a matted-brushed aluminum finish than the glossier M7. The One feels THICK and TOUGH. I don't have to worry about carrying this around case-less(except from drops, which is a whole other issue). I will not be worried about this phone nicking and scraping like the iPhone 5/5s. Personally, it may not have the flair of some of the Sony and Nokia phone of the past, but in totality the One has the best combination of design and craftsmanship. It oozes style and sophistication, unlike the plastic-y feel of the Samsung Galaxy S4/S5. The One is one real looker!3) THE DUAL FRONT-FACING SPEAKERS: We have all been desensitized to the modern smartphones nowadays with their crappy, tinny, mono speaker. I remember the days of the Nokia n95 and n84 with their stereo speakers - whatever happened to phones after that? Whoever agreed to a mono/solo speaker with all the smartphones thereafter?? FINALLY, someone has the senses to come back to reality - thank you, HTC!. Trust me, your ears will thank you and you will realize all phones should have been made like this. Especially when you use ringtones/alerts that were specifically created for this phone, the sound is loud, immersive, expansive, and POPs into your ears. It's simply a re-revolution. Compared to the M7, the M8 loses the Beats audio engineering, but it actually sounds louder than the M7, which although has really high-quality speakers as well, was known for being too soft in certain scenarios. The new moniker is just BoomSound.4) THE CAMERA: I don't use my phone camera to make prints from photos, I have my dedicated cameras for that. So to me, the paramount function of phone cameras is the convenience/accessibility - it has to be able to capture what I want quickly and clearly, with decent enough quality to post online. Therefore, the 4MP size in the One's camera does not bother me at all. Who cares if the camera isn't THE BEST phone camera ever? Because it is not, but it is a GREAT low-light shooter, and to me that's more important than pixel count. The sensors in the camera are bigger than other phone cameras, therefore, it can capture a lot more light, which in laymen's terms it can give you better photos in more situations than other phone cameras can. Also, the touch spot focus is almost instantaneous - this camera is quick, quick, quick! What's really cool about the new camera is the duo camera functionality - each photo you snap is recorded from both cameras, so afterwards, you can re-focus the image, ala Lytro camera style. This is really cool and quite revolutionary for a phone camera. So in the real world, this means no more out-of-focus photos! You can now always re-focus your photos after the fact, so you will not have to regret missing out on a great memory because your photo was out of focus - awesome!5) For a phone with a 5 screen, it's quite svelte, at least at the girth. It's easier to hold in the hand than the Samsung Galaxy S4/S5, and for sure a heckuva lot better than the Note 3. It fits in your hands nicely and securely, with just the right combination of size, weight, and balance. However, it is very TALL, even taller than the M7, so trying to reach the power button with one hand while your holding it in a normal position is almost impossible. HOWEVER...6) The One borrows the features of the LG G2 where you can double tap on the screen while it's off, to turn it on! While the screen is off, you can swipe left to turn it on to see Blinkfeed, which is HTC's version of Flipboard/news reader, and swipe right to turn it on to the home screen. The one thing HTC forgot though, is you can't double-tap the screen while it's on, to turn it off, which the LG G2 CAN do.7) The user interface(UI) and software design is now even more polished,minimal, and simplistic. Sense 6.0 is the on-going improvement from the previous versions. It's really quick and light, not bloated like Samsung's TouchWiz UI. It improves on the older, but still good, Sense 5.0 and 5.5. You can move from one screen to the next lightning quick, almost as good as the iPhone UI.8) And FINALLY, HTC has included a microSD slot so you can add your own memory card for more storage(the HTC DNA/Butterfly and M7 didn't have any). You can add up to 128gb more!The Bad and Ugly:1) The battery is only 2600mAh - I wish it was bigger because I'm one of those paranoid people who always needs my phone at fully charged, just in case, of you know, something. But so far it's been holding steady at about 40% at the end of the day(from 9am-6pm). I check emails, read the news, text, Facebook, etc. throughout the day - I would say that I'm a moderate to heavy user. At least it is a lot better than the M7's 2300mAh battery, which drains super quick, yet charges SUPER SLOW.2) Comparing features with the Samsung S4/S5, the One is not as good. It's not a deal breaker, but for those who like fancy functions, the One will not make you as happy. The HTC One is very simple in its feature set. The one feature I miss most from the new Samsung phones is Smart Stay, where the phone can sense that you're looking at the screen, and won't dim/turn off the screen - that was a HUGE convenience for when you're watching a movie or reading the news. The coolest feature so far for the One has been the tap/swipe to turn the screen on.3) Like I wrote earlier, the size is both good and bad, and it's also heavier than most similar phones. It's taller than the S4/S5, and with the power button up on top, it's almost impossible to do one-hand phone operations without shifting your hand up and down to accommodate both the screen gestures and buttons. The buttons(power and volume) don't protrude enough to make it easy to press them.All in all, I feel the combination of the One's screen, design/craftsmanship, and audio experience trumps over the Samsung S4/S5's fancy functions. The S5's screen is almost just as good - AMOLED screens are known for their deep blacks and saturation, while the One's is much better in direct light, and with a more true color reproduction. The S5 has a higher MP camera, therefore able to take better photos in broad daylight, while the One's camera is more versatile and better in low light conditions. The One has a much better audio experience, while the S5 gives you better convenience with its features - userability goes to the S5 for sure.But in the end, considering the totality of things, I feel the new HTC One provides me the best TOTAL experience, and is the king of the smartphones(at least for now!).","2014-03-26",1

That idea went out the window when I thought of how many times kids drop things and how expensive it would ultimately be. So we went with this. She loves it and is cautious with her minutes.The thing is cute, and while not a smart phone, it's pretty clever. She loves the alarm settings with animated clock, the alerts, and the ability to take pictures and even surf the web. The WiFi sealed the deal.It's built like a Mac truck, and I can count at least three times she's dropped it to prove it. (We are waiting for the case from an Amazon retailer.)The amount of minutes left show up on the screen, but not obnoxiously so. It's easy to use your own photos for wallpaper and for ID'ing friends in the contacts. For the price and features, you really can't go wrong for a first phone.","2014-03-20",1

"171916","The best phone for the price","Sung Lim Oed' und leer das Meer","R2SH8NRN1E85O3","I got the Moto G US version from Amazon around Christmas last year- I was originally going for the international version but most of the units were sold out by the time I got around to ordering them.As far as technical specifications are concerned, I won't bother listing them here since there are about a zillion webpages and tech review sites out there going into those in detail.As a life long android phone user from low-end to high-end, I have to say that this is quite literally the best phone available within the price range- I do not give glowing reviews like this lightly, but the Moto G is an exception. What Motorola pulled here is short of a miracle.If you're ordering this, you're basically getting a phone on a very similar magnitude as the Samsung Galaxy S3, (with half the ram if you're a US based customer, unfortunately- but Moto G's 1GB ram is still enough to do its job) with a lesser camera, no LTE and about double the real world use battery life. Due to the 'skin' on Motorola's version of Android being more or less nonexistent (it is there), they were able to pay more attention to things that really matter, like optimization of hardware components to the Android operating system. Which means in practically all real world usage scenarios the Moto G holds up quite admirably to anything you can expect from last-gen top of the line smartphones that still costs 500 to 600 dollars off contract.I'm what some people might call a power user. I always have a few heavy widgets, mostly pulling data from various mail/message/calendar/to-do service from the net running all the time on all my pages. Such services tend to be very RAM heavy and places strain on processing power and battery life. I also read heavily, text/email enough to write a small book per week, and have a nasty habit of trying to check out a new crop of Android games almost every week. Most modern smartphones doesn't really last more than six or seven hours under my usage pattern during a workday. Moto G, on the other hand, does not fall behind on the performance front, and still delivers around a full day- that's 24 hours, not a 'business day'-of usage, screen time around four to six hours, higher if I'm not doing anything too processor intensive, and remain within wifi zone like my work place.Granted, sometimes I miss the ability to download things at LTE speeds, but I think I'm willing to trade slower (but certainly serviceable) data transfer speeds over freedom of being away from charger as long as I want without nary a compromise.I've shopped around for quite a bit, and I'm pretty confident that Moto G is about the only phone that delivers such level of performance and longevity at the price point. Competitors from Samsung and Sony at $200 off contract price level can't hold a candle to what this little beast can handle. I highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants a great mobile with good fundamentals, with freedom to choose their own carriers and data plans, no matter where they may be in the world.","2014-03-11",1

"116176","LG Tracfone","Jan Papp","R22ZBQBTHSCEJ8","This replaced my phone I had with a large named carrier, when that carrier wanted to up the rate to $30 month access on top of plan charges. I could not justify that for a dumb phone. I use my phone rarely so this fit the bill. The phone arrived promptly, it was easy to port my phone number in, add minutes and set up voice mail.  It keeps a charge pretty good for days unless WIFI is on then it needs charging daily. I haven't had any problems with reception in the city but I haven't tried it in a rural setting yet. This phone fits my needs for a basic phone for emergency or occasional use. The triple minutes for life was the deciding factor. For me it was like getting the phone for free. I anticipate that the minutes will last a year which is about $8.50 month. This beats any deal I could find with AARP, or my large named carrier.","2014-03-23",1

"173178","Good phone for Android enthusiasts","Oleg","R1ZVDRDXCR0A24","It's been around a week since I've got it. The choice was between Nexus 5, Moto X and Moto G.The camera is not that bad. With normal light conditions photos are OK. I've started taking more pics with kids using the phone, which is a good sign of image quality, It has drawbacks in the low light, but it's written everywhere else.As for me, it's the best phone for the money at the moment and it's worth every $. It's fast and it works like a charm. Clear voice when calling, good audio and echo cancellation when calling via speaker, no issues with Skype video calls with decent video quality. I use GPS at car and for sports tracker - GPS works as good as at my specialized Garmin device.And it has lots of opportunities for those who like rooting, custom recovery, cyanogenmod etc. Of course, it voids warranty, but this is 200$ device.

"183490","The (New)ONE to Rule Them All!","Johnny Saigon®","R2KB2VGLSOPPNO","I love HTC phones and I have both last year's One(m7) and this year's(m8). I am NOT affiliated with HTC or compensated by them in any way. I just feel that competition and the underdog companies are crucial and essential for a healthy free market economy, and ultimately, us consumers. I have had the iPhones 4 through 5s, Samsung Galaxy S3/S4 and Note 2/3, and several Nokia(n95-97, n84/85 and several lesser phones) and Sony/Sony-Ericsson(Xperia) phones over the years, and I have loved most of them. For a healthy and positive technological evolution, we NEED the small or struggling companies like HTC to succeed. If Apple and Samsung become duopolies, that will be a dark future indeed. Pick up an HTC One(M7 or M8) and any Samsung Galaxy phones and compare the quality and craftsmanship, and tell me why it's Samsung and not HTC that have more successful phones. It's all about the MONEY and marketing, the bigger guy trying to squeeze out the smaller guy, and that's NOT how a healthy free market economy should be.Now that that is out of the way, let us get down to the nitty gritty. This is my direct comparisons to the iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy S4/S5 and Note 3, but mainly to the last HTC One(M7)(and yes, I am mainly updating keypoints from the m7 review):The Good:1) THE SCREEN: If there was such a better screen on a phone, I have not yet seen it. The iPhone 5s is lauded for its excellent screen, but at its current resolution, it trails behind the One's screen by far. Everything just POPS out at you. Even in direct sunlight, everything is CLEAR and BRIGHT. I really loved the 2013 HTC One's(M7) screen, but once again HTC has outdone itself and given us a true masterpiece in 5.0 1080p(440ppi) form. The main difference between the M8 and the M7 is the color reproduction on the M8 is better and more true-to-life. This is THE BEST screen on the planet right now - WOW!!!2) THE DESIGN/HARDWARE: Once again, the new One continues the HTC tradition of making really high-quality phones with high-class material and craftsmanship. This version has more of a matted-brushed aluminum finish than the glossier M7. The One feels THICK and TOUGH. I don't have to worry about carrying this around case-less(except from drops, which is a whole other issue). I will not be worried about this phone nicking and scraping like the iPhone 5/5s. Personally, it may not have the flair of some of the Sony and Nokia phone of the past, but in totality the One has the best combination of design and craftsmanship. It oozes style and sophistication, unlike the plastic-y feel of the Samsung Galaxy S4/S5. The One is one real looker!3) THE DUAL FRONT-FACING SPEAKERS: We have all been desensitized to the modern smartphones nowadays with their crappy, tinny, mono speaker. I remember the days of the Nokia n95 and n84 with their stereo speakers - whatever happened to phones after that? Whoever agreed to a mono/solo speaker with all the smartphones thereafter?? FINALLY, someone has the senses to come back to reality - thank you, HTC!. Trust me, your ears will thank you and you will realize all phones should have been made like this. Especially when you use ringtones/alerts that were specifically created for this phone, the sound is loud, immersive, expansive, and POPs into your ears. It's simply a re-revolution. Compared to the M7, the M8 loses the Beats audio engineering, but it actually sounds louder than the M7, which although has really high-quality speakers as well, was known for being too soft in certain scenarios. The new moniker is just BoomSound.4) THE CAMERA: I don't use my phone camera to make prints from photos, I have my dedicated cameras for that. So to me, the paramount function of phone cameras is the convenience/accessibility - it has to be able to capture what I want quickly and clearly, with decent enough quality to post online. Therefore, the 4MP size in the One's camera does not bother me at all. Who cares if the camera isn't THE BEST phone camera ever? Because it is not, but it is a GREAT low-light shooter, and to me that's more important than pixel count. The sensors in the camera are bigger than other phone cameras, therefore, it can capture a lot more light, which in laymen's terms it can give you better photos in more situations than other phone cameras can. Also, the touch spot focus is almost instantaneous - this camera is quick, quick, quick! What's really cool about the new camera is the duo camera functionality - each photo you snap is recorded from both cameras, so afterwards, you can re-focus the image, ala Lytro camera style. This is really cool and quite revolutionary for a phone camera. So in the real world, this means no more out-of-focus photos! You can now always re-focus your photos after the fact, so you will not have to regret missing out on a great memory because your photo was out of focus - awesome!5) For a phone with a 5 screen, it's quite svelte, at least at the girth. It's easier to hold in the hand than the Samsung Galaxy S4/S5, and for sure a heckuva lot better than the Note 3. It fits in your hands nicely and securely, with just the right combination of size, weight, and balance. However, it is very TALL, even taller than the M7, so trying to reach the power button with one hand while your holding it in a normal position is almost impossible. HOWEVER...6) The One borrows the features of the LG G2 where you can double tap on the screen while it's off, to turn it on! While the screen is off, you can swipe left to turn it on to see Blinkfeed, which is HTC's version of Flipboard/news reader, and swipe right to turn it on to the home screen. The one thing HTC forgot though, is you can't double-tap the screen while it's on, to turn it off, which the LG G2 CAN do.7) The user interface(UI) and software design is now even more polished,minimal, and simplistic. Sense 6.0 is the on-going improvement from the previous versions. It's really quick and light, not bloated like Samsung's TouchWiz UI. It improves on the older, but still good, Sense 5.0 and 5.5. You can move from one screen to the next lightning quick, almost as good as the iPhone UI.8) And FINALLY, HTC has included a microSD slot so you can add your own memory card for more storage(the HTC DNA/Butterfly and M7 didn't have any). You can add up to 128gb more!The Bad and Ugly:1) The battery is only 2600mAh - I wish it was bigger because I'm one of those paranoid people who always needs my phone at fully charged, just in case, of you know, something. But so far it's been holding steady at about 40% at the end of the day(from 9am-6pm). I check emails, read the news, text, Facebook, etc. throughout the day - I would say that I'm a moderate to heavy user. At least it is a lot better than the M7's 2300mAh battery, which drains super quick, yet charges SUPER SLOW.2) Comparing features with the Samsung S4/S5, the One is not as good. It's not a deal breaker, but for those who like fancy functions, the One will not make you as happy. The HTC One is very simple in its feature set. The one feature I miss most from the new Samsung phones is Smart Stay, where the phone can sense that you're looking at the screen, and won't dim/turn off the screen - that was a HUGE convenience for when you're watching a movie or reading the news. The coolest feature so far for the One has been the tap/swipe to turn the screen on.3) Like I wrote earlier, the size is both good and bad, and it's also heavier than most similar phones. It's taller than the S4/S5, and with the power button up on top, it's almost impossible to do one-hand phone operations without shifting your hand up and down to accommodate both the screen gestures and buttons. The buttons(power and volume) don't protrude enough to make it easy to press them.All in all, I feel the combination of the One's screen, design/craftsmanship, and audio experience trumps over the Samsung S4/S5's fancy functions. The S5's screen is almost just as good - AMOLED screens are known for their deep blacks and saturation, while the One's is much better in direct light, and with a more true color reproduction. The S5 has a higher MP camera, therefore able to take better photos in broad daylight, while the One's camera is more versatile and better in low light conditions. The One has a much better audio experience, while the S5 gives you better convenience with its features - userability goes to the S5 for sure.But in the end, considering the totality of things, I feel the new HTC One provides me the best TOTAL experience, and is the king of the smartphones(at least for now!).","2014-03-26",1

"171238","Best Price/Performance Android phone ever","D. Yanes ChowKaiDeng","RRLXSXEZKZTX3","Both my wife and I own Nexus 4 and we got a Moto G for our nephew just a few weeks ago, so this review will mostly compare the Moto G againts the Nexus 4.The short story is: If the Moto G would be in existence by the time we got our Nexus 4 about a year ago, I would definitely preferred the Moto G over the Nexus 4. The reason: it's price.DESIGNThe Moto G design, although a little thicker than the Nexus 4, it's absolutely beautiful. Most $200 Android phones feel cheap but this is not the case. Materials are great and the curved back it's really great to hold. Buttons (volume rocker and on/off) do a satisfying click when they are pressed.Its screen it's a little smaller than the Nexus 4, but that's precisely a plus for me: I have regular-to-small hands and I can't completely reach the other side of the screen with my thumb when holding the Nexus 4. The Moto G feels a lot better in my hand and has a screen big enough to comfortably browse the web, read a book or watch a show.BATTERY LIFE AND PERFORMANCECompared to the Nexus 4, the Moto G battery life is WAY MUCH BETTER: With the Nexus 4, I need to charge my phone every night and sometimes even charging it a little bit via USB while at the office. The Moto G battery can easily reach 2 days without a charge... of course, this depends on how much do you use it, but I'm talking about normal use.About the performance, the Moto G does a really impresive job, almost as fast as the Nexus 4 (they both have Quad Core processors, but the Nexus 4 has +1GB RAM). You won't feel any lag, at all, while using this phone.CAMERAFirst, let's be clear about something: both the Nexus 4 and the Moto G have regular cameras. They do not have top-notch cameras as other phones. But on the other hand, they are also two of the cheapest (and better built) Android phones in the market. This phones have cameras good enough for everyday use. If you need a really, really, good camera, you could just pay more than three times the price of a Moto G in order to get an iPhone 5S or something like that.That said: The only thing I would prefer of my Nexus 4, it's the camera, which has more manual settings and a better interface than the Moto G. That doesn't mean the Moto G camera is not good: if I had a Moto G, I would definitely and happily live with that camera.PRICEDid I say it already? This phone has the price that a smartphone should have, accesible and proportional to a piece of hardware that we carry in our pockets, everyday, that we can easily drop and brake, and at the end, it will go obsolete and won't be up to date with for the software specs in about 18 to 24 months.If you need a good Android phone that works fast, but you don't have a large bufget to expend, this is definitely your best choice.","2014-04-24",1

"177803","Fantastic phone for the money","Yuriy","RAXAMCJXSHFBU","Having been a T-Mobile customer for nearly 11 years, I was very satisfied with the HTC MyTouch 4G (from 2010).  It was long overdue for an upgrade.  I was considering the Google Nexus 5 and Samsung Galaxy 5, but did not want a gigantic screen.  I needed a phone  portable and lightweight that is easy to hold in my hand/pocket.  After researching for 2 weeks, I decided to give this phone a chance.  For $150 (it's sold at $240 through T-Mobile), this phone is a bargain in terms of the features you're getting for the money.PROS:-very compact and lightweight-fast processor-LTE support-Jellybean installed-excellent call quality-very similar in features/functionality to the more expensive Galaxy S4CONS:-The screen is OK for standard definition, but could be sharper (this is not a phone for you if you're a heavy multimedia user)-The camera/camcorder (5mp/720pi) is average-cheap plastic built (then again, this is also true for the much more expensive Galaxy S4/S5-no notification light-a lot of bloatware appsIn summary, if you don't mind a smaller, standard definition screen and are not planing on heavy camera/camcorder use, this phone is for you-- particularly if you want something smaller and compact than today's high end large HD screened smartphones.","2014-04-14",1

I bought the US GSM-Unlocked-16GB. You cannot unlock the bootloader on this phone. It says that this is an AT&T; phone  and when you try to unlock it message comes up on screen that it is not eligible for unlock. Of course you have to unlock the bootloader before you can root the phone. I bought the phone UNLOCKED. Why does it have the bootloader locked and it cant be unlocked?Phone is Model #XT1034. Obviously it was made for ATT. Other than that, I LOVE the phone. Just wanted to root it.UPDATE: Was able to unlock bootloader and root phone. Just to make a GREAT phone better.

"174843","AWESOME","casey","RDK883SYHX3CD","So, I have had only one other smart phone (NOKIA LUMIA 620 which sucked...ish)(so I'm not the best smart guy), and I like this, did not require data (on red Pocket). I love this phone so far, and I am running KITKAT on this and everything works great and associate with Gmail and Google. I got OSMAND free OFFLINE navigation that works great.  In comparison to the 620, theres no comparison. My 620 was a good starter phone but not for the price, worth 100 at best. This so far is worth every penny....so far.  And it feels expensive and well put together. The style is great but unfortunately its all covered by my ugly OTTERBOX (which fits it perfect, but is not attractive, but oh well). The called quality sounds really good when speaking to people, especially to landline.I admit, I don't know much about the OS android, so I can't comment on that, but the phone seems to run everything really well, movies, games, apps. navigation and voice. uploads downloads. picture quality is great.And in comparison to the Lumia 620, the battery seems GREAT. my lumia needed a charge halfway through the day, and I have the MOTO G all day, doing basic apps, no movies, mainly texting and surfing, and its 30-40 percent down. really great i think.I think if you want the best, than the MOTO X, for someone who doesn't really know all the features of smartphones and wants the luck of a  NICE smartphone, MOTO G. Im sure there are lots of features other phones have that this doesn't, but it has all the important ones people generally know about.I think if your new to smart phones, and don't want to be tied into expensive contracts, THIS is the phone, just don't break it, get a case like OTTERBOX.","2014-04-24",1

It obviously doesn't compare to the top of the line models, but for the price and what this phone can do, this could easily sell for 299 dollars. There are two drawbacks that come to mind though; However, not too major in my opinion. The battery is not easily replacable and there is no external sd card storage. That said, if you get your hands on a replacement battery and a t4 torx screwdriver, and have a basic knowledge on how to use a screwdriver you can replace the battery. As for the limited storage use, you have the option to get the 16 GB version. Or, as this phone is otg capable, you can connect an otg cable and connect a thumb drive to store or retrieve additional media or files. Also, you have free cloud storage such as google drive that can store quite a bit of GB's of files or media.

"174403","Just what I needed","Amazon Customer","RIB5HBLKL9CMT","I've bought this phone right after being fed up with some chinese-designed phones which promised a lot but in fact they were no more than a cheap copy of the best phones in the market, not only their guarantee had a duration of six month but also the phone itslef, and I'm not talking only about the hardware and software but also the relation between both of them.As implied before, I was looking for a phone which really accomplished all things a polished phone should have, that's why I spent more than two weeks doing no thing more than looking for this phone and I've found several, like the Iphone 5s, Samsung galaxy S4, Google nexus 5 and HTC one but, as an average student I couldn't afford them so I kept looking until, from out of the blue I read an article that was Google the one which was at that time running Motorola Company, and one link led to another and as a final result I came up upon this phone.When I first started reading about this phone I was amazed by the fact that it didn't had anything  which disappointed me and, after watching several reviews of it on youtube I decided to buy it.First impressions...As always I had no problems neither with delivery nor with what was inside of it. As expected the phone the second I opened the box was already charming, and I was surprised by the soft design of its curves and the material of the phone because you can tell whether it is a compact stylish one the second you put your hands on it. Right after you plug it in it starts playing a beautiful presentation of which I am still not tired of, but as you may expect there was more to be impressed about, beginning with the 8gb of internal memory which in my case are more than what I need but if you need more space which is understandable you can buy the 16gb version by adding 20 dollars. As it is a quad core phone it can compete in terms of hardware with the high-end phones. When it comes to connectivity the phone has a really fast and smooth connection whether using 3g or WiFi network. The screen is just outstanding, it has a very good contrast and a very good definition as well, the notification light isn't a step back because it has a strong light which turns on and off slightly. Finally if there is something to complain about it would be the 5 megapixel camera which in my opinion it can capture the moment fine and you have the possibility to take a photo of an A4 sheet which in my case it is something which shouldn't be turned a blind eye.Having put all cards on the table I would like to add one more thing which is that the phone is perfectly smooth, it has neither crashed nor lagged, and the reason of this is the complete compatibility between software and hardware because as the Iphone this phone is made by the same company which has built the operating system, something which rarely happens.All in all I feel the need of contributing by recommending this thing and encourage the manufacturing and designing of this kind of polished gadgets which have a lower percentage of revenue and whose aim is to make the best available to the average population.","2014-04-01",1

"130483","A sleek featured phone","James T. Yeh appreciative","R1FKW20BDZF6U5","It has a sleek design which feels like a Blackberry.  The display is very sharp.For a featured (non -smart) phone, you can not beat the price for this quality.  So my rating is having the price in mind.It consumes very little power on standby.  It can last as long as six days without charging.This phone is not very fast, but better than other AT&T; phones I had.  The camera is so so but I don't use that function much anyway.It has a microSD slot which can go very large in storage.  It is better for music than photos.  I tried the image function.  It certainly stores the photos you take from the phone.  But if you load other large size photos into the SD card, the phone does not have enough power to display a large size photograph.  So it you want to use this device to carry photos you took elsewhere, you have down size them first before loading into the SDcard.  But consider other feature phones which do not even display any photos, this is a good function.In addition to the QWERTY keyboard, the has the T9 input function, a smart fast typing capability, good for composing long text content.My only gripe is that it has built in English and Spanish input options, but no other language (e.g. Chinese) input options.  It displays Chinese (incoming text) well.  If there is a way to update the firmware for Chinese input, it will be great.","2014-04-04",1

It has it's downfalls (the camera, being the most obvious), but it performs better and is more enjoyable to use than any phone I've ever seen in this price point. I hope Lenovo continues to put out affordable, high quality phones.","2014-04-01",1
"167369","It works great overseas","Julio Londono","R1E87ARR7T37M0","I bought this phone to use it outside the USA, and because of that I give it 5 stars. I travelled to Colombia, popped in an old prepaid Comcel SIM card and it worked right away, I even enabled a data prepaid plan and I was able to surf the web and use applications like Tappsi, maps, Whatsup, Skype, etc. GPS applications with free maps work great without the need of celular signal and Waze works fine with the data plan, you can even share the internet to your regular phone or other devices using the hot-spot feature.It benefits from the Android operating system and for its price this is the best travel phone ever.Now if you want to use this as a primary personal phone, remember the price you are paying for it, it is not a Samsung Galaxy neither it is an iPhone, the processor is a bit slow and the camera is quite poor, so to put it in perspective it costs less than one fifth of the price of a galaxy or an iphone, so you get one fifth the processor power and one fifth the picture sharpness of the camera.","2014-04-29",1
"152215","Nice smart phone","gordster","R16L7B84XEQB8N","I've been using this phone for almost a month now.  I bought a GSM phone and didn't know what that was but It's compatible with everyone except verizon.  I was trying to get away from them anyway so that was OK by me.  I went to Walmart and got straight talk.  I'm through with contracts and have to wait for the families contracts to end in Aug to finally move all of them from the V.  to ATT.  This phone works really well, I'm kind of slow when it comes to these fancy smart phones and miss the simplicity of my flip phone.  I can check emails, FB and text, plus call all at the same time, quite an impressive phone.  If i was gonna do it all again i would probably get the regular phone not the mini.  My fingers are big and hit the wrong ones all the time.","2014-04-04",1
"162359","Wow, from a tech snob","momo_lainy333","R15FRRFVK2HVW8","Holy cow am I impressed with this phone! I'm a pretty big tech snob, I like the customization of android, I like to root my phones and I hate hate hate bloatware (such as what samsung and LG load up their flagships with) and all the being said I adore this phone. When I first heard of these cheap, unlocked android running, lots of options phones I thought it was too good to be true, and it would end up being like those phones you get in walmart for $50 but this blew me out of the water. It has gesture controls, I was easily able to load it up with a bunch of APK customizations pulled from 4.4, it comes preloaded with a TON of ringtones and the camera is BETTER than my old LG Optimus G Pros (which I LOVED until the screen crashed). The size and weight of the phone are just perfect, not too heavy not too light. The screen is bright and crisp and responds well, the headphones are fantastic, and they look great, BTW Blu i like the ribbon wiring :P, i just overall really like this phone! My only beef is not even really with the phone, I use AT&T; and have data, and when they put the SIM card in it didnt auto retrieve the APN (access point name) to let me use that data so I had to manually find and enter in the data to be able to use any data on the phone, not too hard but a little aggrivating (especially if you are tech illiterate, i am not so its not an issue but i know a lot of people who dont even know the meaning of sim card so....)Anyhoo!  Pros: no bloatware, great price, comes with a lot of accessories, screen is crisp and clear, call quality is awesome, android 4.2 is just new enough to still have shinecons: having to manually enter APNs to use your data, not a lot of 3rd party accessories specific to the phoneoverall it competes with my LG  G Pro, my brothers samsung GS3 and my hubbys Samsung galaxy mega. I cant wait to see what they come out with next!","2014-04-11",1
"148678","Great Phone for the Price.","J. Arnold","R3RE701VN5GX4X","I played around with this phone at the AT&T; store a lot, just trying to make sure it was the phone I wanted. It is my first smart phone and so far has met expectations. As with all phones, it takes a while to go through everything and get the settings exactly where you want them. Once I did that with mine, the phone was perfectly set up for me. The phone by it self is very thin. It makes me feel like I'm playing with a toy. Being my first smart phone, I wanted to protect it (and also give it some bulk since it was so thin), so I got the Otterbox that works with this model. Great companion with this phone. I would recommend this phone and the Otterbox to anyone that wants a smartphone, but doesn't really need the Latest and greatest.","2014-04-01",1

"162536","Great Savings and Replacement","cherie","R3TTCADWQVBI01","I refused to sign another two year pricey contract; so after my contract expired three years ago, I continued usage of the same phone; refusing to upgrade because it would cost more money a month, smartphone or not.  My plan consist of $63 a month for 400 voice minutes, 200 monthly text, extend unlimited evening calling to begin at 7:00pm instead of 9:00pm and 15000 weekend voice minutes.  That is quite pricey for someone who does not use their cell phone a whole lot.  The touch screen on my Samsung A877 Impression stop working; I tried to revive it with a code and it did not work.  So I ordered the Samsung a157V and place my Sim card from my old phone inside the slot and it began to work like a charm.  I have a monthly service plan and this phone is a to-go prepaid phone.  It works, i am not left without a cell phone and the cost was resonable $14.","2014-05-05",1

"157946","Sleek and Useful","prisrob pris,","RBD404X2QINYD","For a woman in her late 60's, i wanted to upgrade from my iPhone 4, with a similar but newer phone.The iPhone5c is exactly what I wanted. I read all the reviews, and this one compared favorably in all aspects.This iPhone 5c is sleek and easy to use with one hand. The plastic casings come in various colors, which is fine, but not a major deal for me. Compared to other smart devices on the market the smartphone isn’t as powerful, but as it runs iOS 7 upgradable to iOS 7.1, I can run almost every application that I want. The 8MP camera featured on the iPhone 5c is the same one featured on the 5s, and it gives photos of decent quality. The camera has a ton of different modes to capture my life moments, including panorama and square photos. The  camera is still one of the best features and I can use videos. The battery of the Apple iPhone 5c lasts about 12 hours of normal usage.This is a great phone for me, and it is an excellent phone for me.Recommended. prisrob 05-05-14","2014-05-05",1
"185371","Brillantly Designed Phone - Many Features - Georgous Appearance","Amazon Customer","RMQCMX1LB1HIQ","I just received the phone today. I've used the Sony Xperia Z, so I could approach the Z2 with some familiarity. The display is big, bright and provides a feeling of naturalness and depth. The sound is gorgeous for a cell phone. I'm listening to Jennifer Koh play a Bach violin partita and it's as if she were in the room. For a brief time I owned an HTC One, and its touted Beats audio sound may have been good for listening to pop or rock, but it could never compare to the Z2 in reproducing sounds as complex and nuanced as a fine violin, a true soprano's (or baritone's) voice, or a string quartet. The iPhone 5s is positively tinny in comparison.It is a phone, after all, and call quality is terrific. I had no problem at all setting up Bluetooth phoning in my car, or in Bluetoothing to other devices (e.g., a Bose speaker) and a kanex keyboard). Texting with images works well (get the automatic downloaded APN settings for your carrier -- mine was AT&T;), and e-mail is fast and easy to read.This is an unlocked phone so it comes with virtually no bloatware. Since I backed-up my previous Android to google, all my music, videos, contacts and whatever were loaded automatically onto the phone. It took very little time to set it up with music, videos and photos loaded. I use a Sony 64 Gig SD card so total useable storage on the phone is about 75 Gig, more than an iPhone that costs a similar $850.It came preloaded with a version of MS Office, but I was able to download MS Office 365 for free and to connect to Onedrive. Using Word, I actually performed real work editing a book I'm finishing.Battery life seems more than adequate and with an SD card slot data storage is limited only by the number of cards you have. It is waterproof, and to protect it from the elements there are hatches over all the entry points -- data card, micro USB port, SIM port, etc. Only the earphone jack is uncovered and as understand it, that fact doesn't affect the waterproofing at all. Leave a hatch open and the phone will let you know on start-up. In lieu of closing and opening hatches I bought a Sony magnetic charger and I'm using Airdroid to load files onto the SD card.Photographs are utterly brilliant, with natural coloring and very fine detail, better detail than I saw on a friend's Nokia, which claimed a 40 megapixel image.I like the phone very much and have nothing negative to say about it at this point.I ordered the phone from Heavy Duty in Evanston, Ill. I got it in two days. The service was unbelievably rapid and responsive.One last thing, it does receive LTE on AT&T; service.","2014-05-08",1

"149070","I absolutely love this phone","Natalie","R22FB6UOIEWPLM","The Galaxy S4 mini is a dream!  It has an excellent camera, great processing speed, and so many features that make things easier (like swipe texting).  It's small enough to fit in my pocket (even with a gel case on it), but it still has a large screen to enjoy.  Comparing it to my old phone would be like comparing a W8 device to a W3.1.  It's sleek and light (this phone is an inch bigger than my last one and weighs less than half).  Its battery was initially draining really fast, but that was because of a bunch of software updates. Once it completed that, the battery life went way up.  The only other thing I've noticed is that when I play games on it, it tends to get pretty warm, but that's the only time.  The speaker quality is amazing.It does come with a European plug, so be prepared to have an adapter or different plug for this phone.","2014-05-10",1

"179011","GREAT PHONE!","A. Baker","RX0D7VR1V0YET","We live in a rural area and had a Motorola C139 and never had any trouble getting a signal inside of our home.  We decided to upgrade and bought a Samsung T404G, but we couldn't get a signal inside the house.  In fact, we had to go out in our driveway to get a signal. A friend told us that Motorolas have better antennas than Samsungs do, so I did some research on Amazon.  This cell phone was highly rated and at a very reasonable price, so we bought it.  Guess what-we can get a signal inside of our home again.  We are thrilled.  Not only that, the pictures that we take with it are much better quality than the ones taken with the Samsung.  This is a great little phone at an excellent price.  We couldn't be happier.","2014-05-12",1

Would HIGHLY recommend this phone.CONS:Speed:A little slow surfing the internet.Screen Quality/Pixels:Okay quality, but the screen is a little too small, especially with the current smartphone trend.Charging:Annoying to charge through the bottom, does not charge well through the side.Apps:Pretty horrible compared to the androids and iphone.PROS:Camera:Unparalleled camera quality. My friends asked what kind of camera I had to take all my great scenic pictures -- thought I was using a Cannon DSLR.  Nope!  Just this little guy.  Fantastic pictures.  Camera glitched out a few months ago and stopped focusing.  But I randomly took a few pictures of a moving fan and it started to work again and worked fine for months.  Don't know how or why, but its fine.Lifespan:Lasted 3 plus years and I was VERY hard on this phone.  Regularly used it in very rough conditions.  Used it in Alaska Snowboarding for music while I lived there, used it back-country fishing/camping, used it doing construction projects were sawdust would go everywhere, etc.  Literally dropped this phone at least 500 times with the otterbox case in it.  Most durable phone Ive ever owned.Battery:  Had phone 3+ years with the SAME battery.  Finally got a new phone today to replace it. Battery life is amazing. Took the N8 out camping from Friday Night through Monday afternoon (on airplane mode the whole time)and took about 100 pics and my phone is still running without having charged it.  Actually, it has not been charged still and its Tuesday night. Amazing.GPS:Typical, but I like that the map works offline.HDMI:Check, what other smartphones have HDMI??!?!Data Use: Some carriers don't consider this phone a smartphone and you can get unlimited internet for a VERY low price -- say $5-6 a month if you catch my drift.","2014-05-27",1

I read all the reviews, and this one compared favorably in all aspects.This iPhone 5c is sleek and easy to use with one hand. The plastic casings come in various colors, which is fine, but not a major deal for me. Compared to other smart devices on the market the smartphone isn’t as powerful, but as it runs iOS 7 upgradable to iOS 7.1, I can run almost every application that I want. The 8MP camera featured on the iPhone 5c is the same one featured on the 5s, and it gives photos of decent quality. The camera has a ton of different modes to capture my life moments, including panorama and square photos. The  camera is still one of the best features and I can use videos. The battery of the Apple iPhone 5c lasts about 12 hours of normal usage.This is a great phone for me, and it is an excellent phone for me.Recommended. prisrob 05-05-14","2014-05-05",1
