"1210","The guide sucks","You'd be better off using the internet to figure the game out. The guide feels super cluttered, it's almost hard to read and it doesn't tell you everything at the right time. I think it feels cluttered because there's too many pictures in it. Every page has at least 7 or 8 images on it. The best thing about the guide is the production value but I didn't buy for that",0
"1766","Don't support this writer by buying this piece of trash","A friend recommended this book which I unfortunately bought.  I feel sorry for people who think that this is ""writing.""  The author not only contradicts herself but the writing is shallow and lacks any depth.  If you want to feel good, buy yourself a bottle of wine, not this book",0
"1840","Mixed feelings","I've used the lonely planet guides on other trips before, and have always been very pleased, but this one left me with a different taste in my mouth.  LP was the only guide we purchased, based on our previous experiences with them, but we had the chance to peruse others in the B&B's we stayed in throughout our trip.  Of all of them, I'd rate the LP as the 2nd best for our interests - as they say, individual experiences may vary!  Ireland has become a very expen$ive tourist destination, so upon reflection, we would have been happier with the Rough Guide.  LP has just tried to hard to cover all levels of expense in one guide, and has ended up short-changing all of them in the process.  I hate to say it, but I'd rather see them do one thing well than 3 things mediocre at best.  I'd still put it above most of the other guidebooks though.Our first and foremost gripe is how out of date the price estimates on everything are.  I realize it was published two years ago, but we gradually learned to depend on everything costing about 20% more than LP listed.  That's quite a jump for 2 years, indicating to me either poor fact-checking for the 2003 edition, or some pretty crazy inflation and a need for another update.Our second gripe was the local maps.  They failed to provide maps for a lot of the smaller cities, and only provided maps of the city-center areas in the larger ones.  Given the rarity of Irish street signage, those maps would have been a God-send for navigation in towns.  Also, and this may be a function of the 2003 printing, a lot of the towns in Ireland are instituting one-way patterns in their city-centers, and LP's maps rarely identified this.  A third, again related gripe is with the existance, or lack thereof, of the various restaurants, b&b's, shops, etc. listed in the guide.  Probably 30% of the restaurants in the guide just aren't there any more.  I realize they must have been when it went to print, but that didn't help us any.Our last gripe is the rather uneven coverage of large areas of the country.  Granted, it reflected perfectly the tourist patterns - heavy coverage of larger cities and popular tourist areas along the coasts, pretty awful coverage of less touristed interior areas.  Unfortunately, we didn't just want to go where all the other tourists go, so this left our noses still further out of joint.Overall, I'd say if you want a guide that covers the sightes well, both LP and Rough Guide do that.  If you want to keep the expenditures down, Rough Guide does it much better.  If you want to go all out, um, there's probably a third option, but neither of these two will do it well.  If you want to be thrifty in some areas and splurge in others, then this guide is the closest you'll get to filling your schizophrenic needs in one place - although, in that case, I'd really recommend getting two guides, one for each end of the spectrum.One last piece of advice - buy a heritage card when you get to your first castle/tomb/historic place!  If you plan on visiting more than one or two historic places, its 20e cost will be recouped within days with all the free admissions it will get you for the rest of the trip",0
"1932","A soap-bubble book","I was disappointed greatly at the time I opened this book. HUGE gaps between strings, LOTS of empty space on pages - all this is for masking the simple fact: this ""200 pages book"" contents could be easily printed on 80 pages or even less. And, more, these pages are filled with useless ""interviews"" (who wants to read an interview INSTEAD of explanations?!) and other empty words. The book is supposed to teach us how to make modules for NWN 2. But it doesn't. See, the chapter about scripts consists of 4 pages - is it REALLY enough for such a great theme? (These pages, I mentioned it already, are less than 2 pages...). This book is better than nothing. A bit. Because SOME useful information it provides. And that's all good that could be said about it",0
"1674","Talk about a tornado in a trailer park........... ","Between the ""Glamour Shots & Easy Sex, Different Babys' Daddys"" What else is there? Oh yeah, the many scripture quotes & abortion info.  Dont forget unprotected sex with every man she dates. Dont forget letting a strange man pick your daughter up from school. Poor Amber!This gave me insight alright, on how dysfunctional Amber Frey is.Shame on her for using Laci's photo!   I hope that she spends her profits on much needed therapy & a Tubal Ligation!  ",0
"1855","Should get ZERO stars","This is one of the few books so bad that I couldn't finish it.  There is no explanation of how things work,or in many cases what they really are.  I feel like the only motivation for any of the characters was greed, sex, or guilt about greed and sex.  Do not bother with this book",0
"1076","Crops, Crops and More Crops","I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, ""Collapse"" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK",0
"1632","Where did JA Jance go?","I own and have read all of JA Jance's JP Beaumont and Joanna Brady mysteries and eagerly look forward to the next episodes in these character's lives.  I picked this book up, thinking it would be on par with all the JA Jance books I've read previously.  What a crashing disappointment.  I can't care about stereotypical characters in unbelievable situations - truth be told, I kept looking at the cover to see if I'd picked up a Harlequin by mistake.  I'll probably read more Ali Reynolds books if this is indeed a new series, but I'd much rather see what happens with JP and Joanna - incidentally, I didn't think much of either of them, either, when their paths crossed some books ago.  This one gets a big ""Aw, c'mon, JA, you can do much better than this!"" from me.  For those who haven't read previous books and happened to have the bad luck to pick this one up as your first JAJ, get the JP Beaumonts and start at the beginning.  They are worth the time and effort",0
"1393","Better off reading his column in women's magazines","I stumbled across this book by accident at my library and decided what the heck, all those millions reading Gray's franchise can't be wrong.  Plus, I've seen Gray on Larry King once, and he seemed like a nice and reasonable enough guy.  This book, though, promising in its intro to be ""sexy"", touched more of my comical than my sensual nerves.  Now, I am not above accepting bedroom advice where it's warranted (for instance, it is thanks to Dr. Gray that I finally made sense of that night years ago when my husband slept on the couch after a huge fight caused by my criticizing a movie we'd just went to see).  But Gray's generalizations, dumbing down of most issues and sharing his own sex life with his wife Bonnie were mostly unhelpful, and I suspect that the passages I found funny were involuntarily so. Although I'm the first to admit that women love compliments, Gray's suggestions, as displayed in several top 10-lists of things to say (and, occasionally, what not to say) were a tidbit too repetitive (ever wonder how many combinations you can play with the phrase ""your breasts are wonderful""?  Read the book!).  Almost as enlightening was the hot tip on how, while getting to the undressing part, the man should pull the woman's panties ""up her crack"" (a.k.a. give her a plain old wedgie--no joke).  And, don't miss the one where the Mongolian woman pulls a flag at full mast when she's in the mood and at half when she's not (or maybe it was different colors, I couldn't read clearly through my tears--no offense to the Mongolian people!).More annoying were the recurring (and very stereotypical) assumptions that a woman always needs 10 or more times more cajoling into sex than a man (in various ways, be it foreplay, flowers or the favored seduction line hit lists), that a man always comes (and too quickly, of course), and that you need constantly innovative acrobatics in the bedroom, or your (otherwise mutually comfortable and sure-fire, I wonder?) approach will become a ""turn-off"".Bottom line (no pun intended):  if you want some light and basic (!) guidance, the book is not too terrible, but if it is ""advanced bedroom skills"" (Gray said that!) that you're after, you're better off digging out that old Erica Jong or even any pulp.

"1741","Confusing but better than nothing","Overall I found this guide pretty confusing, but I guess it is better than nothing.  There are better choices, and some may want to consider auto-formatting software such as Eazypaper and others. ",0
"1733","A B movie in Paper Form","I picked up this book at the airport as I was heading to Japan. While staying with my in laws in the country, there is no English language anything. This is all I brought so I had to finish it. But it was a struggle. Firstly I like complex thrillers, and I liked all the Tom Clancy Jack Ryan series. Technically excellent, if with totally one dimensional characters. This book reminds me of the original Star Trek, where everyone but the Captain is affected by the virus. The hero is always right. Bell can write, his prose, I think is fine, but the scenarios are sometimes laughably implausible. I also agree with another reviewer here that there is an unpleasant racist overtone in some of his depictions of some of the bad guys. Overall awful, just awful. My first and last Bell book. I will be leaving the rest of the Bell collection on the shelf",0
"1368","Haunted","Yuk!!! Worst Book I've ever read - I read alot and with alot of variety. This book stinks (too farfetched, retched, disgusting and plain weird).",0
"1335","Great concepts that go nowhere.","I zipped through the first 100 pages of this book unable to put it down.  Unfortuneately the author seems to run out of gas after that.  The main character just goes on a big, boring sight seeing tour.  It reminded me of that show on the Travel Channel where that girl visits hotel after hotel fawning over the interior design. There is not a hint of conflict until the final pages and then it's very short-lived and quickly followed by one of the worst non endings I've ever read.  The book just stops.  Not a hint of resolution or even a cliff hanger pointing to a sequel.It's a shame because Grimsley had some great concepts to work with.  In my experience novels that mix technology with magic usually fail at both, but Grimsley had a workable foundation he could have developed into something unique if he had focused on the SF concepts instead of minutiae.  Once in a while the characters stop admiring the drapes long enough to notice the GIANT FREAKIN' PORTAL BETWEEN TWO WORLDS--but enough about that.  Gee, what a lovely sofa..",0
"1665","I Tried","This book irritated me on many levels; not that the writing was poor or the plot weak. In fact, the plot, the premise, the writing were good--unfortunately the characters didn't pull it off or keep me interested because they were all kinda indifferent or unlikable.I read somewhere the number one reason people keep reading a work of fiction--regardless of plot--is because they care about someone in the book. In this book, I was hoping they would all drown by the end of the story... ",0
"1319","Surprised by animal cruelty and mishaps throughout book!","Wow, I was expecting a fun, light read, and in the first chapter already had to skim over a couple of paragraphs relating to ""mishaps"" that happen to animals in Zippy's life. Well, I thought, next chapter will be better. NOT. The next chapter included a graphic scene of chickens being slaughtered by shovels! Every chapter so far has had something very disturbing about animals in it! If you are sensitive to these things, I would not recommend the book. I'm not sure I'm going to finish it at this rate. Granted, I AM super-sensitive to any animal suffering, but this is really overload. I'm halfway through and so far this is the list: The aforementioned chicken slaughter, a neighbor stealing her cat and starving it in the basement, another neighbor looking to poison her cat, dog-sitting for friends and losing the dog and not worrying about it that much and finding him dead days later, her father going out with a shotgun to kill the dogs who massacred Zippy's pet chicken, joking about a neighbor enjoying ""puppy stew"", keeping her two dogs penned up, torturing a raccoon by holding in front of 30 braying hounds.... I mean, does that seem like a lot to you??? For a light-hearted ""tender"" memoir???? Jeez louise! I can't sleep at night from this book",0
"1996","a nice place to visit....","If I had been an editor and received ""Deadly Slipper"",I would have said the following:""Dear Ms. Wan,Your book is unacceptable for the following reasons:1) The Setting.  One hazard of writing about the placewhere you spend your summers is that you end upwriting through the eyes of a visitor rather than anative.  Dordogne sounds delightful,and I'd certainlylike to visit it based on your descriptions ofdelightful pigeon coops and sheep scattered across thelandscape, but it is disturbing that you havecicadas singing in May.  It suggests you are onlyfamiliar with the setting during the vacation monthswhen you habitually visit. To really describe a place,I think you need to know it better.2) The characters.  Because you spend your summers inDordogne, you appear to know only other wealthyforeigners.  All your main characters are expatriateswith irritatingly bourgeois occupations.  I don't knowif you realize that all the native-born Frenchcharacters you portray are ugly, boorish, sexuallydepraved, mentally defective, criminal, or terminallyquaint, and they all appear to make cheese.  Surelythis isn't a realistic portrayal of the French.3) The Orchids.  Actually, the orchids are fine, butthe idea that orchid fanciers are maniacal andpossibly homicidal is a questionable one; most orchidfanciers are fairly tedious.  Also, the idea that a ladyslipper mutant would spontaneously occur and allow theorchid to live outside its native habitat is idiotic. Anyone would tell you that a hybrid is a better bet.4) The Dogs.  One cute dog is sufficient; two are toomuch.  Puppies are inexcusable.5) The Romance.  Most mystery writer are aware of thehazard of including a romance in a mystery, but youwalked in innocently, unaware that your two charactersare unpleasant, self-involved and have no chemistry(and that's not even mentioning their unspeakabledogs).  You set a big obstacle in their path by havingone think the other is a deranged serial killer; agreat writer might be able to pull this off, but youcan't. 6) Trendoid aspects.  Epistolary novels are *so* 18thcentury.  But having a NY psychiatrist profile theserial killer by email is so LAST WEEK.  You will besorry you did this, sooner rather than later.  7) The Ending.  Ridiculous and melodramatic.  Georges Simenon wrote about crime with great psychological acuity.  You should read one of his books.",0
"1211","Not for a modern economist","Book is out of date with modern economic thought.  Essentially restates classical economics and provides little in the way of acceptance of the need for balance between government and the markets.",0

"1122","I really wanted to like this book","If Julia Glass had not set the bar so high with Three Junes, I would have given the book 3 stars instead of 2.  There are sentences, paragraphs, even pages of brilliance in this book, but it is as if winning the National Book Award gave Ms. Glass unconditional confidence in her writing, and character development in particular.  She seemed out of touch with the major demographics the narrative slings around.  As another reviewer wrote, the writing process seemed transparant.  Reading the book, you get the feeling that the characters are what Ms. Glass (a privileged white woman of a certain age) imagines teenagers, or New Mexicans, or black chauffeurs, or Hispanic nannies, or even gay people to be like.  She is like a tourist who voyeuristically delights in other cultures without really understanding them.  The teenagers and the Santa Fe inhabitants are the most painful examples of caricatures.  Greenie might be the most believable, and although I understood why she was falling out of love with her gloomy Alan, I wasn't sucked along with her when she falls in love with ""the other Charlie"".  He was only very mildly interesting and certainly not worth (even temporarily) losing your child over.  With Saga, she manages to develop her most sympathetic character, but Saga's life is left floating and unresolved at the end.  Even the brief appearance of Fenno, who I loved in Three Junes, lacked intensity and seemed gimmicky.  All and all, a very disappointing second novel.  You have to wonder, since most reviewers are pointing out all of the same problems with character, what good is her editor? ",0
"1771","PAIN AS GOD'S MEGAPHONE","Since God is Infinite Goodness, we must conclude that the appearance of reckless divine cruelty is a delusion.  When we are comfortable, we are too shallow-minded to realize that we need God.  Since God knows that He is the only thing that we really need, He inflicts pain upon us to wake us up to this fact.  So pain is God's megaphone.  If some people, such as the Jews, try to love God without going through Christ, it is not yet God - merely the best approximation their fantasy can attain.  Hence poor God is forced to keep screeching at them through His megaphone.  But even people who try their hardest to love the true God, such as Job, or C. S. Lewis for that matter, cannot adore God as much as He wants to be adored, so He uses pain over and over again to ""plant the flag of truth within their rebellious souls.""    Where does this notion of an Infinitely Good God come from?  Given mankind's painful existence, ""an inference from the course of events in this world to the Goodness and Wisdom of the Creator would be preposterous.""  God had to reveal Himself to mankind by Revelation; thus it is in the likes of Abraham and Moses, who identified God as righteous, that all peoples are blessed.  Lewis informs us that God expostulated with His own creatures on the basis of their own ethical conceptions - ""What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me?""  One has to wonder if Lewis has ever actually read the Bible.  Can anyone really deny that if a leader of today did exactly the sorts of things that Abraham and Moses did that they would be decried by all of sane mankind as monsters?  I have never understood why, or how, I am supposed to pretend that this is not true.  Of course, God is wiser than me, so if I could only see it from God's viewpoint, I would see that the butchery of whole populations, including babies and animals, was actually an act of love.  In MERE CHRISTIANITY Lewis condemns this line of reasoning in eastern religions as ""damn nonsense.""  Undoubtedly, we get the impression of a just and loving God through the teachings of Christ, but the conviction that God is Infinite Goodness, Omniscience, and Omnipotence did not come from biblical revelation; it was developed by medieval Christian philosophers by reasoning through extrapolation -- a process that Lewis, rather inexplicably, deems impossible.Lewis's insistence that people have free will needs to be examined.  Even as he describes it, since we are born in sin, we cannot use free will to avoid sin, and most people are blind to their sin.  Hence, it logically follows that there can be no free will without the ability of self-perception.  The evidence suggests that incessant pain, especially when inflicted upon children, destroys this ability.  Abused children typically grow up to be abusers.  In my own case, I adamantly insist it was the drug, marijuana, which first gave me introspective ability, at the age of 23.  Prior to that moment, God knows that I had no free will.  Free will is not a realized trait that we are born with, but a potential ability that requires a great deal of effort to develop.  In most people it remains largely dormant.  Since free will is dependent on self-knowledge, the role of religion needs to be the development of introspective ability.  Dogmatic adherence can only hinder this.Lewis is at least honest enough to acknowledge evolution.  Unfortunately, it is hardly possible to reconcile the notion of evolution of man from animals with his fairy-tale notion that animals only exist by destroying each other because they were corrupted by Satan before man's appearance on Earth.  Somehow, the perfectly good ""Paradisal Man"" descended from animals already corrupted by Satan.  Lewis can be abominably silly sometimes.Lewis is given to disjunctive, either/or, logic.  Either the common human experience of supernatural awe is a mere twist in the mind with no biological purpose, or it is direct experience of the supernatural - a Revelation.  I would once have scoffed at this, but a Numinous vision of Christ was the major turning point of my life.  The problem is that this Revelation was not at all consistent with Mere Christianity.  According to Lewis, the purpose of pain is to break our will, since it is our tarnished wills that keep us from God.  I had only recently come to realize that I had not had free will until my sense of self was awakened by an illegal drug.  I experienced Christ in the very moment that I was cursing Christ for demanding that I beg forgiveness for that which He was responsible.  Albeit, at the time I was an atheist, and was only cursing at what I had been taught about Christ.  I experienced Christ as the core of my being, not as an entity completely separate from myself, and as an awakening of will, not a surrender.  Lewis assures me that the feeling of being one with God, rather than a creature of God, is Satan's ultimate deception.  But I have also experienced Satan within myself.  If Christ were not the core of my being, I would never have survived Satan.  I know the difference.  I do not acknowledge that Christianity has the authority tell me what my experience of God must be.I am a scientist by training, not given to superstitious credulity, however much like it what I have written above must sound.  In my attempt to make sense of my experience of Christ and Satan battling within my mind, I have come up with the following myth:  It is, at least, not completely unreasonable to assume that consciousness is an inherent quality of existence.  This consciousness would first be in a primordial state, probably in some way responsible for evolution, though not by anything like intelligent design by direct control.  There could be no distinction between good and evil; in fact the terms could have no meaning, until consciousness evolved to a complexity capable of self-awareness.  As self-awareness developed, so did awareness of pain and terror, and a rebellion against achieving a level of awareness capable of experiencing pain.  The human mind, as the vessel of consciousness experiences these antagonistic trends and, for whatever reason, tends to personify them as God and Satan, or their various cultural equivalents.  What makes the Christian God so detestable is His complete refusal to accept responsibility for anything.  Satan can therefore be described as ""God's self-ignorance.""  Buddhists are apparently able to put themselves into the conscious state of inanimate matter, hence there insistence that good and evil are identical.  C. S. Lewis tells us that ""it is not God's purpose that we should go back into that old identity.""  I think I agree with him on this point.  Mankind's goal must be to attain free will be becoming conscious of what we really are.(Peter Payne, author of CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA:  A YOUNG MAN'S ENCOUNTER WITH THE EVIL WITHIN HIMSELF)              ",0

"1193","Read ""Blindness"" and Pass on The Plague...","Dr. Rieux, the main character of the novel, moves throughout the book in a detached surreal hopeless manner.  He goes thru the motions of ""doing his job"" while death surrounds him from a wide spread and accelerating plague.I find Jose Saramago's ""Blindess"" to be a far superior book to The Plague.  Similar theme and concept but more descriptive and moving.  The Plague was clinical in its approach - almost bloodless.I found this highly acclaimed book to be very difficult to re-read, often having to re-read many pages over and over.  I would pass on this book",0
"1878","formulaic and unsatisfying","I have enjoyed the Miss Julia books tremendously but this is my least favorite.Miss Julia is married to Sam Murdoch. Poor guy is sent to find the missing Hazel Marie in one part and is gone for a good deal of the story. Miss Julia does not even make a case of those missing hours! It is as if the author could really care less.There are so many little plots that you feel as if the author had several ideas and just took one and expanded it but left the others to show all the complications in this woman's life. There are times when Miss Julia seems to self-centered and the tongue in cheek mood of the other books in this series is really not present here. I found her less likable and also less believable. She has taken in her husband's mistress ad illegitimate child. Now, there is a question about the child's paternity and she is tolerating the whole thing!!!!!Perhaps other books in the series would be a better intro for the uninitiated",0

"1292","really bad sociology","My understanding is that this book is an accessible summary of the ideas Catsells presents in his three volume magnum opus, the Information Age (which starts with the Network Society). If this is so, I am definitely not missing much by not having read the trilogy. This is a really bad piece of sociology, characterized by a technologically deterministic analysis. Why did I give it two stars instead of one then? Well, it does have some OK parts. Catsell's analysis of the origins of the internet is an interesting bit of the sociology of technology and what saves the book from pure technological determinism. He also presents some convincing data (gathered by other people) that use of the internet for socializing does not suck people into an on-line world, alienating them from the world of face-to-face interaction; this happens in the case of a few troubled people, but most people use the internet to enhance their already existing off-line relationships. The rest of the book basically argues that the network format of the internet is reshaping the rest of society in its image, with everything from big business to governments to social movements adopting a network form in response to the rise of this new technology. This is, frankly, ludicrous reductionism. It doesn't even stand up to a simple test of chronology--a lot of the developments that Castells argues are driven by the internet predate the explosion of ist usage in the mid-1990s. As Castells himself admits, businesses were already taking on more of a network form before the internet appeared big time on the scene, and social movement scholars have shown the same is true of transnational social movements. On top of this, Castells shows an effusive enthusiasm for all things networked, whether they be transnational corporations or the transnational social movements that oppose these same corporations. I'm really at a loss to understand how one can enthuse about both of these opposed phenomena. Castells does see some of the problems with the new network society--loss of job security and the digital divide, for instance--but he tends to downplay these. And his solution to these problems tends to come down to more of the same--more internet access, more network social organization. Talk about a narrow vision",0
"1296","Too popular to bother trying anymore.","J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way. In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.As to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  A very disappointing book",0
"1559","There's a sucker born every minute","This book is an excellent example of how creationists approach science: write a book with a lot of bafflegab that sounds scientific but is actually devoid of any meaningful content, and then finish up by concluding that evolution is impossible. What a bunch of baloney. First of all, evolution, in the sense of ""common descent,"" is not impossible. Even ID-iot superstars Michael Behe, Stephen Meyer, and Jonathan Wells have admitted as much. (See a summary of their recent testimony in the Kansas biology curriculum hearings in the evolution/creationism forum at the West Virginia Gazette. (wvgazettemail) (put ""/forums"" after com) So any ID-iot who thinks all that bafflegab about irreducible complexity (IC) and the nonsense in this film is the death knell of evolution is simply ignorant.  Man evolved from non-human ancestors. Get over it. Thaxton in particular ought to read that summary, since he himself was one of the witnesses and looked particularly ID-iotic.  In any case, the empirical data discussed in this book is indeed nothing but bafflegab. Talking about the allegedly empirical foundation for intelligent design makes it sound deliciously scientific, especially to poorly educated ID-iots, who generally are clueless about real science; but even if the empirical data is accurate, it's nothing but a facade, because it has nothing to do with the book's main conclusion. For example, imagine your neighbor told you that his dog could play Beethoven concertos on the piano. Skeptical, you ask for proof. ""Simple,"" your neighbor replies. ""See, here's my dog, and there's my piano."" Only a moron would accept that as ""proof,"" and yet ID-iot Christians are more than happy to accept exactly that kind of ""proof"" from ID-iotic films like this. The problem with your neighbor's ""proof"" is that it proves only the existence of the dog and the existence of the piano.  Neither of those issues, however, was the real cause of your skepticism, so the ""proof"" was entirely meaningless. The critical issue, of course, was not the mere existence of the dog and the piano, but rather the ability of the dog to play the piano, and your neighbor's ""proof"" was completely silent on that issue. Again, only a moron would accept evidence of mere existence as proof of piano-playing ability. In this book, there's a lot of talk about how complex certain biological systems are.  That is nothing but meaningless bafflegab, because the mere existence of complex systems is not a disputed issue. The disputed issue is how those systems came into being, and on that issue the book's ""evidence"" is completely silent. This book was designed to fool poorly educated, easily impressed ID-iots.  Judging from the five-star reviews, it seems to have succeeded.  Well, there's a sucker born every minute, and apparently a lot of them are found in evangelical churches and seminaries.  In one of the very first evolution debates, Thomas Huxley accused Bishop Wilberforce of using his intellectual and oratorical gifts to mislead and bamboozle people.  Things haven't changed much since then. Instead of meaningful evidence, this book substitutes a God-of-the-gaps argument. ""Gee, look how complex it is. It must have been created by an intelligent designer. Maybe, just maybe, it was God. Wink, wink."" God-of-the-gaps arguments are dumb. Only ignorant suckers are taken in by them. So if any of those folks who wrote five-star reviews for this book would like to buy a nice bridge in Brooklyn or a dog who can play Beethoven concertos on the piano, please give me a call.  I'll be happy to provide evidence!",0

"1787","Meh","Jesus, talk about the little girl crying ""wolf."" When I picked up this book, I expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with. What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption. The book starts out promisingly, even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose. We're given the account of Charles Monet, one of the first documented cases of the Ebola virus. From there on, Preston gives a description of the virus, what it does, how it does it - the works. Then, he moves on to the Human Component, the cast of characters, so to speak, for the big story.The big story is, alas, not so impressive. It's a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about, but nothing of the sort happens. Basically, people run around in bio-hazard gear, fret a lot, and monkeys die. In between, Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the Ebola virus, cases of people being infected, ""crashing and bleeding out,"" cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys, unless you're a PETA type.The worst thing about The Hot Zone is just how self-indulgent Preston is. He starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book, which is a noble idea, but not when they don't die at the end. Basically, he's trying to make you care about these people, and all for naught. And by the time that you're supposed to be truly concerned, you actually WANT them to die, because you're tired of hearing about him describe, in active detail, what they eat in the morning, what they do in the afternoon, and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night. When you're addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus, why are you spending time talking about Nancy Jaax's hands and karate prowess? Moreover, when you've finally gotten to the monkeys, why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the wild? Does anyone really care?I wish I could say that this book moved me in ways other than to reverse my peristalsis, but I can't. Preston's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are tiresome and unnecessary; he had the chance to write a compact little thriller about an averted crisis of global proportions, but he instead chose to ""get into the minds"" of his subjects. And what a bore that became. There were only two redeeming aspects of this book: one was the description of the African, human Ebola victims, and the other was the description of the virus itself, although, again, both were sabotaged by Preston's inability to write. If you want to know something about Ebola, go get An Idiot's Guide to Dangerous Diseases and Epidemics. If you're pining for the namby-pambiness of the Human Element, read The Hot Zone. Personally, I like to avoid rereading the Uncle Tom's Cabins of scientific accounting",0
"1423","poetry in Riis' How he oher half Lives","How the Other Half Lives was written over a century ago as an expose' of the appalling living conditions in the tenements of New York City. The author speaks with a crusader's zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements, these streets, and these people as if they were living today. This is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men, the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of New York City in the late 1800s.  He so graphically describes the filth, the sunless and airless rooms, the crowding, and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart.  Riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people's plight. His pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery. He, for the most part, blames the money-hungry landlords for these crowded conditions: ""How shall the love of God be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man."" (p. 266). He laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor. Then, after his extensive discourse, he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions, something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers. Riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says, ""If this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice, it has served its purpose."" The author apparently succeeded with his purpose, because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us: ""This book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major U. S. cities.""How does this book relate to adult education? By moving chronologically from the founding of America to the slums of NYC in the 1800s, are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years? Certainly Riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem.  ""Thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education, all the more urgent because these people are poor, miserably poor almost to a man."" (p. 147). He does not forget that this ""education"" is not only for the poor people, but also for the wealthy landlords. ""Clearly, it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant."" (p. 270). Riis' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity.  ""It is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society."" (p. 233). The relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society.Although this book was exhaustive in its detail, it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening. I found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that Riis used for the different races. In a sense it reads like a Ginsberg poem; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era. Read these geographic names out loud and feel their rhythm:Jewtown, Bandit's Roost, Double Alley, The Bowery, The Bloody Sixth Ward, The Fourth, Fifth and Tenth Wards,  Blindman's Alley, The Bend, The Battery, Little Italy, The French Quarter, Hell's Kitchen, The West Side, Bottle Alley, Frog Hollow, Poverty Gap, Murderer's Alley, Gotham Court, The Old Brewery, Old Africa, Potter's Field, Blackwell's Island Asylum, Rogues' Gallery, Penitentiary Row, Chinatown. The list goes on. To someone reared in rural America, this chant sounds like a song about another country.  Riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of New York City: Chinaman (he can't be taught), (Chinese (coolie--laundry business), Polish Jew (coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling), Russian Jew, Jew (money is their God), Bohemian (poor, but thrifty), Blacks (like to gamble, but they are clean), Greek, Hebrews (tailors, all of them), Dutchman, Irish (like to drink and have expensive funerals), German (order loving), Swiss, Pasquales, Russian, Italian (a born gambler; lighthearted and gay), Swamp Angel (thieves), Street Arabs (army of homeless boys), Tramps and Toughs (the world owes them a living),and the Celtics. I was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and Riis' comments about every race. I noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day. Riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday. I hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days. Does every generation think that is happening in their time? Not only should this book be used by people researching New York City`s tenements, but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change. It is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man's greed overrides his concern for human dignity. ",0
"1345","A Light weight novel with little plot or character development","I was disappointed with this novel which is set in my hometown of Chicago.  I had hoped that the author would have taken advantage of this setting, but it really seemed as if he had just read one of our gay newspapers and pulled out a few names to function as place names.  The plot is trite as are most of the characters.  Characters change their ""stripes"" at the drop of a hat.  The book has a certain fairy tale, and they lived happily ever after quality that I found really disconcerting.  I would have been more ""satisfied"" if Dean (the main character) had turned out to be an ax murderer!  Just kidding of course or am I?

"1501","Weak Link in a Great Series","I read A is for Alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series.  Years later I read S is for Silence and was hooked. I started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning.  I have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine (and forgiven Ms. Grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6"" frame).  However, I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best.  You just can't believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few.  The dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous, and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics.  But even with these issues, I did finish the book.  Grafton at her low point is still a good read",0

Some ""intellectuals"" actually support the tired mantras of Marx's philosophy, whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who haven't seen enough sunlight, I don't know. In any case, if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property, and is totalitarian and slave-driving (the government owns everything, including you). And the deaths caused by communism are hardly necessary to bring up. Pol Pot, Mao, Stalin (of course), etc etc...who are these people kidding",0

"1307","Decent/lofty ideas... but lacking...","The trouble starts early. There is an apologetic preamble which states that the author(s) would not dedicate precious space to titles that are well known and well documented beyond the gaming community. This is an enormous assumption about the general public's knowledge - both of video games and more-so it's history of design. Many people that have heard of these games or seen their children watch the TV-spinoffs, most likely would not be able to identify what the games actually look(ed) like or anything about their play dynamics in a gaming environment.Even though Mario, Zelda, Pokemon, Donkey Kong, Defender, Asteroids, Missile Command, Frogger, etc. are mentioned briefly there are no images of reference for these classic games for us to (a) review and recognize, and (b) learn from. If this is supposed to be a sort of retrospective of the graphic art of game design (this is not about studies of techniques for rendering) then why not show some of these all-time classics as well as the 'new-time' classics? The latter are better represented throughout the book but some of the choices are omissions are questionable. The brief smattering of 'classics' that are shown tend to be more human-looking figurative than 'iconic' which seems lacking to me in breadth and style of representation.Beyond this much of the work - but not all - feels and looks rather 'same-y' to me. Lots of brooding dark scene-scapes and characters clearly inspired by countless horror/goth/fantasy masters such as Boris Vallejo or much of the work seen in Heavy Metal. When there is mention of games that are actually considered modern art on display at world-famous museums, such as ""Rez,"" -- we are not shown any images of it because space was taken up by two nearly identical renderings of Lara Croft(!) in the same spread. One has to ask oneself: what was the author/picture editor thinking?The fact of the matter is that for all the long-winded talk in the intro there is little to graphically show us where the industry came from verses where we are now. And from what I can tell, there is absolutely no mention of the explosion of games and utterly unique designs being done in FLASH. Arguably one of the largest and least expensive/complicated environments for making a unique game. Furthermore, all the games covered and talked about (that I can tell) are from very large corporations and as such tend to be slanted and biased in a number of regards.My biggest problem with this book was the editing - particularly with regard to choices of art. Far too many examples if things that look the same versus examples of unique design concepts and forms as well as proper representations for an historical analysis. Very nice printing, some nice layouts, and some interesting topics are raised with relation to character conception versus form, versus environment - but I would not recommend this for critical graphic design analysis or critical anything",0
"1232","Nothing special here","I read this short novel because I greatly admired Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning ""Killer Angels,"" and because I'm a baseball fan.  The novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher.  It's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot.  The characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories.  The feel or atmosphere just isn't quite there.Any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away, flaws that distract and damage the work.  Shaara sets most of the novel in Yankee Stadium with the Hawks playing the Yankees.  Why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear.  The Hawks apparently are from Atlanta, but an Atlanta team, Braves or Hawks, whichever, would not be playing the Yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season.  Finally, when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game, he does so in the semi-hidden bull pen down the left field line in Yankee Stadium--not on the mound on the field.This book was published posthumously and Mr. Shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose--prose that was excellent in ""Killer Angels.""  It's unfortunate.There are glimmers of interest in the book, but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author's other book",0
"1515","It's exciting, it will sell, but it's just not happening","﻿Millennials Rising is the latest book in the generational series by the authors William Strauss and Neil Howe, focusing this time on the generation born after X.For those not already familiar with the authors' theory, Strauss and Howe are two authors who began writing about generations in 1991. They wrote the book Generations, which introduced a theory that generations fall into four re-cycling types, and each type comes of age during a different kind of era, or ""turning"". The Silent Generation is of the ""adaptive"" type, for instance, passive, gentle, and in tune with their emotions, and came of age during the Golden Age of postwar America. The Baby Boomers, remembered for their ""Awakening"" in the 1960s, are of the ""idealist"" type, concerned with God and spirituality and impassioned about what they believe in, but inclined to change during life (from hippie to the current ""Just say no"" control freak). Generation X, which they named the Thirteenth Generation, is of the ""reactive"" type, being alienated, street-smart and materialistic, without a feeling of need to be ""loyal"" to anything, coming of age during the 1980s and 1990s. They then first identified everyone born since 1982 as the ""Millennial Generation"", and predicted back in 1991 that it would be grow up to be optimistic, hard-working and clean-cut, just like the G.I. Generation that fought World War II, going back to the ""civic"" type generation before the Silent Generation. In 1993 they published the book Thirteenth Gen, which specialized in Generation X and why they are the way they are. In their third book, The Fourth Turning, they went back to the whole theory and writing about all the generations. They also changed the archetype names from adaptive, idealist, reactive and civic to Artist, Prophet, Nomad and Hero. Strauss and Howe wrote in this book about an upcoming era of epic battle and mass destruction, much like the one in which the G.I. Generation came of age. They then predicted the Millennial Generation would form the role of Heroes during the coming crisis, and they would lower teen pregnancy rates, stop using drugs, serve the United States, in uniform even, and desist with using profanity.So then in 2000 they put out this book, Millennials Rising. In this one the authors try to explain the Millennial Generation (my generation). Millennials Rising attempts to identify who we, the most ethnically diverse generation in American history as they note, are. In Millennials Rising they write about this generation's Boomer parents and their influence on the Millennial Generation, as well as the kind of world in which this generation is growing up (which S&H think of as hundreds of television channels, SUV lifestyles, rappers who swear, and people who smack each other on TV). The book states that Millennials want to work together in teams, believe the people in authority know more about right and wrong than they do, are enthusiastic about learning and going to school, are loved and protected by their parents, achieve great things in school and will achieve great things in the future, and lest we forget, always want to exude that ""positive peer pressure"" on their fellow Millennials.The obviously leads to the question, then, is the generation really optimistic, hard-working and clean-cut just as they say? Consider this: Only 28% of high school seniors say that the work they get assigned at school is ""meaningful"", only 21% describe their courses as ""interesting"" and still barely over a third, 39%, believe that what they do in school will have any relation to their success later in life. The generation was supposed to be enthusiastic about learning. The Millennial Generation also rapidly increased drug use, especially pot, from the level at which Generation X was using them in its teens, as even the authors themselves note.S&H portray the world of edgy entertainment, such as television shows, movies and music, as a Zoroastrian battle. In popular music, for instance, artists are described by extremes that either represent the alleged Millennial values or go actively against them -- on one side, artists like Eminem, Limp Bizkit and Marilyn Manson, on the other, boy bands and Britney Spears and her imitators, along with such second-tier bands as the S Club 7. They do not deal with the Millennial interest in bands that lie somewhere in between the two. For instance, Blink-182 is just about the biggest band around now, and yet Millennials Rising does not mention Blink-182 and the many young fans who make the band a success. South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut is the authors' idea of where popular culture is today. Millennials Rising heralds boy bands as what music will increasingly be like as the current decade unfolds, and blasts the ""edgy"" bands as groups that will be washed away, but could the authors have predicted bands like Good Charlotte or artists like Avril Lavigne?This leads to the bigger question of whether the book and the theory will be able to predict anything. S&H write about ""rebelling by being better"" during the present decade. Apparently, their idea of rebellion is not listening to Limp Bizkit, blasting censorship, or doing illegal drugs, but wearing preppy clothes, waiting until marriage to have sex, and trusting their government. According to them, we should expect to see Millennials petitioning for policies that will punish their own peers. S&H write that we will accept the draft and join the military in great numbers when the crisis presents us with a war, and even do National Service. Frankly, can anyone imagine any more than 20% of today's high school students doing their duty and risking their life in war in the name of America? Also, our generation has done nothing to make a commitment to following Bush as leader during the Iraq War, while S&H predict Millennials serving their president. How suited to a Hero generation is that? The G.I. Generation followed FDR so blindly they had to print his campaign materials in Braille. When it comes to rallying around their president and leading the direction of the nation during a crisis, Millennials have surely disappointed those who expected them to do just as the authors said we would. This, of course, does not have to be a bad thing, but it does make you wonder about the limitations of the predictive abilities of the theory.Some parts of it make for very interesting reading, but all the talk about how they are to be the ""next great"" generation gets to you sometimes. S&H seem to believe you can never think too big about those Millennials. Millennials Rising presents an image of youth that is set to amaze you and will attract readers, but sometimes what the book describes just isn't happening",0
"1687","McJihad vs. Reality","This book is inexplicably influential, probably due to its catchy but ultimately meaningless title. Barber fails to convincingly analyze an interesting thesis, instead delivering an exasperating 300 page-long list of every single thing on Earth that he disagrees with. Barber contends that natural human political behavior results in smaller and smaller ethnic enclaves trying to separate themselves from the larger world, while unchecked global capitalism is erasing ethnic flavor with bowdlerized mass-culture sameness. Interestingly, Barber contends that these two contrary movements are actually in an unholy alliance, using each other's excesses as excuses for their anti-democratic behavior. That is a fascinating thesis, which makes the weaknesses of this book all the more infuriating. The first part of the book is an interminable tirade of lists within lists, of cultural trends that Barber disdains, in an avalanche of complaints that is not analytical but merely selective and arbitrary. It's all tied together with attempts at ""edgy"" pop culture references, made-up terminology (like the annoying ""infotainment telesector""), and pseudo-intellectual quotations and namedropping. All is lumped together unconvincingly under the anemic term ""McWorld,"" which is so vague and all-inclusive as to become meaningless. In his never-ending examples of how recent cultural trends are damaging the freedom and intelligence of the masses, Barber merely comes across as a condescending snob who thinks his own interests are superior, or a curmudgeon who thinks everything was better back in the good old days, or both. In the second part of the book, Barber proceeds to throw obtuse political science theories at various world hotspots, in which tribalism and separatism are damaging the integrity of nation-states. His umbrella term for this phenomenon is the dangerously loaded term ""Jihad."" Note that this book was published back in 1995, so that word was not as prevalent in Western discourse as it is now, but Barber still uses the term as a loose descriptor which is likely to offend both devout Muslims and ardent anti-Islamists.When it comes to the specifics, many reviews here and elsewhere list out the numerous flaws in Barber's arguments, and there are so many of them that a lot of reviews are necessary for the task. You can agree or disagree with various critiques of Barber's contentions based on your own personal politics. But everyone will probably conclude that in this book's final section he does not deliver on the ironic implications of his initially intriguing thesis (embodied in the book's title), and simply forwards borrowed theories on civil society and the public sector. Overall, this book is mostly the longwinded grumblings of a nostalgic know-it-all who portentously predicts doom for every single cultural and political reality of the modern world.

Cornwell's last two or three misfires, Reichs is way wide of her usual high mark here. In this offering, Temperance is out of character, out of both style and focus, and the story is just overly convoluted and circuitous; a yarn that meanders around heading every which way except toward a finished product. Even the writing is unfamiliar and not of the same voice Reichs has maintained in her many Brennan novels. Having finally given up on Cornwell, after many years, I'll hang in there for one more Temperance Brennan dig; everyone is entitled to one gong",0

"1574","K is  for killer...","Well, if anything this was a decently written story, with good dialect and character detail. However, this story felt like it was going around in circles without any indication of ever ending. Grafton seems to have an idea of where she wants to go with this story but never really gets there.  The story starts off with PI Kinsey Milhone in her office at night when she hears a knock on her door. She opens it to find Janice Kepler, mother of Lorna Kepler standing before her with the tale of her daughter's mysterious death. Not only this, but she also explains to Kinsey about how no one ever solved the murder because Lorna's body was left to decompose for ten months in her isolated cabin house. They talk for a while about the strange circumstances surrounding her daughter's death until Janice tells Kinsey about a pornographic video that was sent to her house after Lorna's death. This tape leads Kinsey on a wild goose chase of suspects in the red light district and gets her nowhere when it comes to turning over the real murderer. 	Millhone dives even further and searches through the world of Lorna's day job where she uncovers a mysterious lead about an expensive, elaborate project which is angering several people a considerable amount. Kinsey also checks up on Lorna's family members, and with the exception of Janice, all seem to have a motive to murder her Lorna. 	Not being a fan of these types of novels, I decided to at least give it a chance but this story got me nowhere. By the middle of the novel I wanted to give up and skip to the end of the story, but when I got to the end I had to go back to the middle to figure out how everything ended. I stopped caring about the whole murder after so much more emphasis was placed on so much side stories and it seemed like Grafton did too. The ending left me with a strange feeling and I didn't know if the book had actually ended. All in all, it was just not the right kind of book for me but if you're a murder mystery fan, try any other of Grafton's alphabet themed novels besides this one",0

Without Lenin's apparatus of social repression and Trotsky's apparatus of military dictatorship, Stalin would never have been.The Russian Revolution was never a win for workers. It destroyed them, some 4 million at Lenin's hands, 30 million by Stalin, and 65 million by Mao Tse-tung.No policy or ideology that denies the soul can ever succeed. And communism does just that. By denying that which makes humans humans, it can bring only suffering",0
"1831","Yuck, Yuck, and double Yuck","This is like teen-love-fiction, and by that I mean it's like a teenager wrote it, one who uses bad detail, cliche phrases, overused idioms, bad dialogue and poorly crafted plot.Meet mr. millionaire who teaches polo to a woman -- and they of course fall in love, slowly, boringly, painfully.   Then the kids come in and the remainder of the book is like a couple dealing with kids, with no plot development. Yuck.She says on the back she's responding to a call for something like energy and thrills and sexy writing.  Uh, not in this one.  The only sexy scene is on page 138, and that's not very good either.  The best part of the book is that it proves she really does need to go back and learn the craft of writing because either she never learned it or she forgot what she learned",0
"1421","What A Crappy Book","I'm thankful that I was able to get this book at the library and didn't spend $15.00 buying it.  I own The Blue Day Book by the same author and I think it's fantastic and it cheers me up right away.  He should have stopped with that book. It claims to be a witty, thought-provoking book that makes an ideal gift for anyone who's seeking their true purpose and wants to laugh along the way.  The only thing this book has going for it is the amazing animal pictures.  It did have one thought that I really liked:  ""Some people say that life is all about acquiring knowledge.  If that's true, then why do smart people dress so badly?&quot",0
"1480","If only I could have back the hours I spent reading this book...","I have read all of the Scarpetta novels through The Last Precinct, and I have never wanted hours of my life back as I did when I finished The Last Precinct.  Cornwell tried to go in a new direction with her writing, and it failed. If Kay Scarpetta was a fortune teller, this book may have been alright...  What I mean by that is, in at least 2-3 separate occassions in this book, Kay says ""I had a feeling I knew exactly what [so in so was going to say/do to me...""  Really Kay? Out of absolutely nowhere, you just believe that the unusual way Marino has been acting is due to the fact that you are going to be prosecuted by a special grand jury for homicide even though NOTHING led up to your supposed ""revelation."" You are truly impressive.  Reading this book makes me want to steer clear of Blowfly and Trace, but then again, maybe Cornwell read some reviews and saw that she had to shape up.  This book really ticked me off and I wouldn't recommend it to an enemy",0

"1643","Wade ","I give this book a low rating because of the misinformation that Nicholas Wade has presented and in the manner it was presented, ""DNA and the Secret Family of Thomas Jefferson.""This most difinitive ""unproven"" statement leads the unsuspecting reader to believe that he ""seems"" to know so much about genetics and early man that he knows all about the Jefferson-Hemings DNA Study and for what ""reason"" he sees fit to include it into a serious scientific book as being very suspect as mentioned by some reviewers. He seems to not associate science and truth together as it pertains to the Jefferson-Hemings controversy. Unless I overlooked it, I saw no reference to the excellent work that genetist  Spencer Wells is performing for National Geographic Socity.  I assisted this study by providing access to Jefferson DNA  sources. The result of a match was found in the early Phoenicians,(Caanites mentioned in the bible)and in lands that today are Syria and Lebanon.  From what I know of the study (I assisted Dr. E.A. Foster with the DNA study), Mr. Wade's analysis of this is extremely limited, in fact, it is extremely biased. ""Thomas Jefferson fathered an unacknowledged family with his slave mistress Sally Hemings"" (pg 257). What truthful fact does he have to give this statement? He makes the most of giving details by lying James Callender and lying Samuel Wetmore/Madison Hemings in Pike Co., Ohio. Why the details in a book topic such as this? I will give you serious readers on the serious DNA topic my opinion. As you may see in my several reviews of other biased books, these authors know nothing of the details of the DNA Study but spread old early biased media tales. He did not inform you that a team of blue ribbon scholars (13 senior professors) for the Scholars Commission ([...]) and determined that there is no proof that Jefferson is guilty of these charges. You may read on my web page: www.angelfire.com/va/TJTruth all the details of this study. He cannot plead ignorance of the details because I sent him my research early in the media blitz and any reporter not using the many search engines to thoroughly search a subject is most suspect in my opinion. Can any serious researcher read his book and believe he/she is receaving accurate knowledge. My knowledge of the other topics he has written about is limited, BUT I do know this Jefferson-Hemings Study and he has done no current or original research. He references Annette Gordon-Reed as some type of ""authority"" on the controversy. She was charged by the Scholars Commission Report as having completely rearranged a letter from Jefferson's grand-daughter to give a negative meaning to her words. To add insult to his otherwise feeble attempt to influence your thinking, Wade has a figure with the title, ""Thomas Jefferson Family with Sally Hemings.(Pg.260-261)."" His lack of knowledge of Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson is most lacking in current research because he goes into details that Martha Jefferson and Sally Hemings are half-sisters (an old political rumor brought forward by people wishing to confuse readers and to be politically correct. He does not mention a very scholarily book by Dr. and Mrs. James McMurry, ""Anatomy of a Scandal, Thomas Jefferson and the Sally Story"", who did deep research on this rumor and found it a lie designed to fit earlier political mud slinging. Since he did not give the reader another source for study, another VERY interesting book, ""Jefferson Vindicated, Falacies, Omissions,and Contradictions in the Hemings Genealogical Search"", I will tell you it has a foreword by former Monticello Director, James A, Bear, Jr. All of the named books, including, ""The Jefferson-Hemings Myth"" are available through Amazon. I do agree with Wade's last sentence on the Jefferson-Hemings controversy.......""Some mysteries lie beyond the power of even DNA to resolve."" I might add that contrived history is intertwined with DNA and even the Hemings will NOT permit the gathering of ""another"" Hemings DNA source.....only ONE originally tested.Herb BargerJefferson Family Historianherbar@comcast.net          ",0
"1338","The Careless Characterization of Helping Professionals","McKnight's concerns about communities' dependency on professional assistance are legitimate, but disturbingly overstated in this book.   In the end I felt McKnight's trashing of the already well-trodden government provision of social services may not be altogether helpful to distressed communities.  He sidesteps concerns of capital mobility and exploitation and the pernicious effects wrought by years of discrimination.  Any debate over when and where and how social programs can be effective is cast aside as well, since in McKnight's picture, social programs and the professional service providers are, in fact, the vilains and culprits for most of what ails society.  One of the damaging fallacies that seems to be perpetuated in this book is that service professionals are not able to be both professional and caring - the two are deemed mutually incompatible.  Mcknights views resonate with employers' caring rhetoric - conveniently invoked every time a healthcare worker tries to claim she does care about patients but is still entitled to a living wage or, perhaps, health insurance.   What is further implied is that communities will readily and ably take up the reign of providing for themselves and their members when denied more institutionalized professional services.  It seems implied that communities had no problems before the social programs to solve them came into being.  In this, I think I see McKnight is invokeing an idealized notion of an society at an earlier time; maybe his argument would have seemed more reasoble in a time when families were less geographically mobile and may have constituted an economic unit, when the elderly lived shorter lives and were less numerous themselves with more children to care for them, and the local economic activities were more functionally interdependent.  But McKnight's model for today's cure doesn't seem to fit today's conditions.  On the other hand, McKnights solutions may be the only ones available in a society where budget cuts and elimination of social services seem the prevailing trend.",0
"1062","LIES, DAMNED LIES, AND STATISTICS","It was Mark Twain who popularized the aphorism of Benjamin Disraeli that there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.  I kept hearing all these marvelous things about FREAKONOMICS, a book by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, so when I ran across it at 25% off, I did a stupid freakin' thing and bought it.  I thought, What the freak, I've got a pretty inquisitive mind and I'm open to seeing things differently, to discovering new viewpoints.The doubt started early when I got the book home and I first noticed the glowing comments on the dust jacket from the likes of Time, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Los Angeles Times.  When all of the liberal news agencies are lining up to tell me how wondrous a certain publication is, I'm immediately going to be freakin' suspicious.  Author Malcolm Gladwell tells us on the cover, ""Prepare to be dazzled.""  Well, evidently Ol' Malcolm is dazzled a whole lot easier than I am.  (I won't even mention the smug mug of Stephen Dubner that taunted me from the book's dust jacket because I don't want you to get the idea that I judge a book by its cover.  Or in this case, a writer by his physiognomy.  So I won't mention that.)If you're the kind of person who is amazed to learn that 70% of auto accidents occur within 10 miles of a driver's home, then you just MIGHT be dazzled by FREAKONOMICS.  If I tell you that the company that issues its 5-day-a-week employees only 3 uniform shirts, thinking that it is cutting costs, is probably increasing its overhead, and this fact astounds you  - if you must ask ""But how?"" - then yes, buy FREAKONOMICS and be dazzled.  Mostly what FREAKONOMICS offers (when its conclusions can be trusted) is just what we used to call ""common sense.""  But since America has been reduced to a bunch of corpulent, brain-dead zombies staring vacuously at that box of SURVIVORS, and AMERICAN IDOLS, and LOST knuckleheads, good old-fashioned common sense now appears to dazzle the dead (when you can sever them from that box and put a real book in their hands, that is).I dove into FREAKONOMICS hoping to find my purchase worthwhile.  I got no further than page 13 when my fears were realized: everything would require second-guessing and verifying.  On that page, Smug Mug tells us (based on a single report by the Institute Of Medicine) that ""drinking eight glasses of water a day has never actually been shown to do a thing for your health.""  Fortunately, I read YOUR BODY'S MANY CRIES FOR WATER by Doctor F. Batmanghelidj over a decade ago so I already knew what a bunch of bunk that was.In chapter 4, Smug Mug ""proves"" that legalizing abortion in 1973 with the Roe v. Wade decision was responsible for a national drop in the crime rate.  This represents the centerpiece of his book, both literally and ideologically.  The first thing the reader must accept is that there really has been a significant drop in crime since the early 1990s.  On page 92, the author acknowledges that the police in Atlanta were discovered to be underreporting crime in the early `90s in hopes of landing the 1996 Olympics.  Well, would police forces nationally have an incentive to underreport crime generally if it has actually dramatically increased since the `90s as predicted?  True, being honest might be means to an increased budget, but it sure would make your department appear inept and unable to maintain control.  And surely the Chamber Of Commerce and the big business interests would frown on that public perception.  Let me ask, do YOU actually feel you're less likely to be the victim of a crime now than you did in the early 1990s?  That's funny, me neither.  There's so much crime now that some of what was once reported to the police agencies goes unreported, and recently, an ex-police officer friend told me that cops can no longer engage in some of the micro-policing they were able to do in the `80s and `90s because crime is so out-of-control now.In dismissing other possible factors responsible for the huge drop in crime (if this claim is a verity), Dubner states that increased police personnel accounts for only 10% of the drop.  Having a bit more insight into the nature of police work than does the average civilian, it's funny that I find myself even contending with the stats Smug Mug uses that actually WORK AGAINST his theory: I believe the wide-scale hiring of police officers since the early `90s could have impacted the crime rate only minimally - less than the 10% - while actually increasing the municipal coffers via traffic citations significantly.  And Dubner concludes that right-to-carry firearm laws ""simply don't bring down crime.""  (Be sure to read the utterly fascinating book, GUNFIGHTERS, HIGHWAYMEN & VIGILANTES by Roger D. McGrath, for a decidedly different and scholarly viewpoint!)In dismissing all explanations for the unexpected drop in crime except legalized abortion, I didn't notice any mention of the tremendous increase in homeschooling and the proliferation of private schools since the early `90s, and I wonder if that might have some statistical bearing.  Ya think?   Yes, I think Smug Mug is selective.  He calls some abortions a ""crude and drastic sort of insurance policy.""  Not ""immoral.""  Not ""sinful.""  But then I didn't expect Smug Mug to call a sin a sin.  And even if Levitt and Dubner's hypothesis is correct, that abortions have lowered crime, the fact remains that not every aborted child would have eventually murdered an innocent person, but every aborted child was an innocent person murdered.  So why are we even discussing this?  I'll tell you why: because the pro-choice folks can feel a slightly shifting consensus, and now they're pulling out all the stops, trying to ""statistically"" convince the masses that they're safer with all those unborn potential criminals missing.  I find this repulsive!  (And there are studies indicating that those missing people have, and will continue to have, a negative economic impact on society.)I won't even go into chapter 5, What Makes A Perfect Parent?  Suffice to say that as usual (surprise! surprise!) all the statistics Dubner employs nearly always seem to confirm the rightness of the liberal dogma on each issue.  Funny how those crunched numbers always crunch conservative beliefs.  Just know that if you're a working mother, you haven't cheated your child in the least, but if you're a dad who thinks that an occasional spanking is in order, you are ""unenlightened.""  If your kid is watching lots of TV, it isn't turning the ""child's brain to mush.""  (No word on whether or not it's turning his/her morals to mush though.)  And the studies (that we are called to pay attention to) show ""that a child's character wasn't much affected whether or not he was sent to day care, whether he had one parent or two, whether his mother worked or didn't, whether he had two mommies or two daddies or one of each.""  (I've often wondered what might have happened to me if my Mom, who was home most of the time, hadn't been there to hammer the dangers of drugs into my head day after day, year after year, while I was growing up in the `60s and `70s.)I've given FREAKONOMICS two stars because I did find the section on the naming of children very interesting, as well as the story of Stetson Kennedy's fight against the ""three Ks.""  But if you're smarter than I am, you'll borrow this book from your library rather than paying money for it.  Economically speaking, that's just ""common cents.""",0
"1064","Vastly Over-Written and Vastly Over-Praised","From the remarks at this site, people either love this novel or hate it. I hated it. I hated it for the reason that it represents all that is bad about MFA program writing in the last 30 years. The emphasis is entirely on STYLE. Forget story. Forget that your reader needs some reason to be reading the narrative. Just throw out and string together wonderful language and the reader will follow you anywhere. Some of this thinking goes back to Henry James, some of it goes back to Virginia Woolf who was so terrified of books with plots or dominating conceits (like H.G. Wells' THE TIME MACHINE). The first 100 pages of this novel are about a real estate deal and the people to whom Frank Bascombe is trying to sell a property. It's brilliantly written. In fact, it's so brilliantly written that I had a lot of problems seeing a former sportswriter being so introspective and articulate about his life, his loves, and the region of the country he inhabits. This book has no driving plot. In fact, it's an arbitrarily chosen conceit: what happens on July 4th in the life of one guy. It's not James Joyce's ULYSSES nor is it trying to be, but EVERY thought this man has is in this book. And none of it is related to a plot or story or any reason whatever why a person--any perso--should pick up the book. Indeed, that seems to be the crux. I read this book because it was by Richard Ford, a man whom all of my colleagues in the mainstream fiction world revere. You must read this book, they said. So I did. And I consider it an extraordinary waste of my time. To be sure, this is a judgment call, but I'm allowed to make it. EVERY reader is allowed to make that call. But I know I'm in the minority in this. This book is supposed to be one of the greatest American novels of the last 25 years. But will it be so in another 25 years? Are novels now only to be interior monologues (which Virginia Woolf preferred and said so in her essay ""Modern Fiction"")? Perhaps our values are changing. Perhaps the MFA programs in this country are correct in only cultivating style rather than story. But what it eventually evolves into is a form of narcissism, wherein the author writes at length, putting on the page all of his or her thoughts about whatever and we're supposed to . . . what? Applaud it? I believe that the authors we'll remember will be the natural storytellers. I don't think Richard Ford is one of them. But, man, he sure can write",0
"1531","Skip it","I enjoyed Andy Kessler's book about finance (Wall St Meat) but this one is just silly.  It seems to show the wisdom of the old writer's saw about sticking with something you know about.  This book is like sitting in a bar listening to a drunken bore try to impress you with all the little bits and pieces he heard at a hospital that day.   I couldn't wait to get to the end so I could throw it out",0
"1640","very disappointing...","I have been reading a series of autobiographical accounts of modern day warriors and had high hopes for this title.  As others have pointed out, Coughlin's ego can be suffocating at times.  This could be forgiven if it were the books only flaw.  Alas it is not.  The writing is amateurish at best and the author's overuse of adjective and hyperbole is very distracting.  The language is disjointed and unnatural as if it were written with the heavy use of a thesaurus.  Again this could be forgiven as we're reading this book for a soldier's account, not that of an English grad student.This book offers a stark contrast in comparison with Nathaniel Fick's ""One Bullet Away.""  Whereas Fick seems to be an intelligent, thoughtful and humble warrior whose primary concern is the welfare of his men, Coughlin conveys himself as a shallow intellect with more concern for personal glory and satisfaction than anything else.  He is a team player when he hand picks the team and considers them worthy of his own company.You cannot know a person from reading their writing but Coughlin's character development is very superficial.  His attempts to convey a ""human side"" are unbelievable and seem grossly contrived.  This is a great contrast to the character development in ""One Bullet.""  There is no connection between author and reader in ""Shooter.""  Coughlin does not develop the role players either.  In ""One Bullet"" you really feel the brotherhood developed among the officer, his NCOs and the enlisted men.  Additionally, Coughlin's demeaning descriptions of his support staff (non-trigger pullers) is tedious and only reinforces doubts about his team ethic.To make matters worse the action isn't as well developed as in other titles.  The author's self-congratulatory tone and emphasis on personal exploits, with plenty of after-action chest thumping, obscures the view of battle.  He spends little time on the finer elements of sniper tradecraft, training and shooting.  This can be found elsewhere.Overall this book was a great disappointment.  If only a fraction of Coughlin's self-acclaimed exploits are true, then he is a remarkable sniper.  He should let his accomplishments speak for themselves and not try to beat us over the head with them",0
"1180","Maybe I'm justing getting older","I have read all of the Artimis Fowl Books and loved them until nowI was disapointed with this one, and not found Artmis unusaly irritating, but felt the whole book was the lacking the charm and wit that had made the other three so good. Truth be told I was younger when I read the first three, but still I can reread them and enjoy them (as I did after reading the fourth and being very disillusioned with the whole seris) so if you want my advice then I suggst you don't buy this book and let the magic of the first three live in peace",0
"1249","Good, but has a few errors","It has the potential to be a great book if the author had taken some time to actually look into each breed. The ""Canadian Eskimo Dog"" is now referred to as the Canadian Inuit Dog out of respect for the Inuit people. He has the dog's height wrong, and the weight range is much too high. This leads me to conclude that if there were that many errors on one dog breed, who's to say that it's not wrong on other breeds too? I was quite disgusted and mad to see the ""designer dogs"" put as purebred dogs. Labradoodles, Bichon/Yorkies, Cockerpoos, and Bull Boxers are NOT purebred dogs. They are mixes given a fancy name and sold for staggering amounts of money. The first few chapters on the history of the dog is quite fascinating though, and the pictures are nice. If you need an all-in-one book and don't mind many errors, this is a great book for you. If you're like me, go down the road of buying a better dog encyclopedia and different books on different subjects rather than this faulty all-in-one",0

However, after reading Botox Diaries, I felt compelled to write and warn you all that this book is dull, trite, and disjointed.  I love my ""chick-lit"" books, but Botox Diaries is a disgrace to this genre.  The plot is weak and unrealistic (even in light of the suspended disbelief one normally affords ""lite & fun"" books).  The plot is also disjointed, perhaps because two authors co-wrote this book.  The characters are shallow and excruciatingly dull.  Botox Diaries is absolutely the worst book I have ever read. -- December 2005 Update:  My friend insisted on reading this book (ugh...despite my warnings!).

"1207","Absolutely biased and poor political/religious sensitivity","Having read Clive Cussler adventures for over 10 years, i was totally disgusted with the redneck and narrow minded attitudes expressed in the book. The father, who does not stay with his son, decides to revenge his son fighting a war trying to kill people in someone else's country. That is perfectly justified!The book mentions Hindu mercenaries who have not been seen anywhere in the world in any century much less this one. This is a direct insult to all Hindus as being one I am astonished at the insensitivity of the author. How come ""Hickman"" is not a ""Christian"" mercenary or for that matter the Corporation as they seem to be in this for the money. The justifications are ridiculous. India and Hindus of India have been terrorized, jailed, colonized and robbed by Christian and Muslims alike over the last 1000 plus years. You don't find us calling people by religion and we have all major religions in our secular country. We have grown spiritually to accept everyone, and I would like the authors to read more than a 2 page synopsis on religions before writing books. The book smacks of jingoism and is a pathetic display of the authors minimal knowledge of religions and global affairs",0
"1595","Lacks detail and helpful tips","This is not one of Lonely Planet's best guides.  There is suprisingly little information.  For example, the book mentions that there are a few companies that give day tours from Rekyavik but doesnt tell you anything about how they compare in price or services.  basically, everything in the guide and more can be found at the tourist information center in Rekyavik, which luckily is run very well.  I found this really disappointing since Iceland is very expensive and I was hoping to keep down costs (in reality this is almost impossible, even eating at the grocery store I was spending 10 dollars a meal for bread and cheese) Furthermore, Iceland is a very small country and it would have been very easy to have given a lot more details.As with any tour book some of the info is out of date.  some of the museums and businesses were closed including the Icelandic Phallogical Museum.  It also seemed that this book was written for the high season in the summer months.  I went in March and found the information on the offseason limited and sometimes inaccurate.  I usually trust Lonely Planet but in this case I would have tried one of the other guide book companies or simply visit the tourist center when you get there.",0

MacLeans dialogue between his characters is comic book variety at best. There are also a few glaring errors that I am surprised that his editor did not pick up on, two of note: Shaffer (supposedly from Montana) is credited with a Mid-West accent?? Montana is far west not 'mid' west.  Secondly, Nazi helicopters?  This is just plain sloppy.  MacLean should have known much better.This one belongs on the bookshelf of a teenage boy.  For a better read of MacLeans better works I reccomend; HMS Ulysess and Bear Island.  The characters are far more credible and provide a better story by far.  A poor effort by Mr MacLean",0

"1224","This book isn't for everyone","I bought this book this weekend as we're doing the pre-five in a Row w/our preschooler and I don't much like it. I've got a mother w/borderline personality disorder and who doesn't observe personal boundaries of other's what-so-ever (if I need a break away, she hunts down my poor husband, all my relatives and friends- ugh) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as I could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom' mentality. In the end, I think if a person is from a semi-normal household w/proper respect for a child's boundaries and need for space away from their parents, then this book is okay. I just find some moms are too smoothering- even ones w/o personality disorders- and this book doesn't send a message about love as much as 'I own you'. I like 'Mama Do You Love Me?' better for explaining to a child a parent's unconditional love.'Good-Night Moon' by Margaret Wise Brown, however, is by far my children's all time favorite book.

"1976","Poorly researched, and not accurate for many drugs","Unfortunately, Sidney Wolfe and the whole ""Worst Pills"" business enterprise is riding on the reputation of Public Citizen as a champion for consumers, but has failed to live up to it with this guide. In some cases, warnings are included regarding various drugs that are not based on scientific reports, but rather, are based on the marketing literature and information from the pharmaceutical companies themselves -- hardly an unbiased, consumer-oriented source of information. Consider as one example the book's ""Do Not Use"" warning regarding the prescription drug, Armour Thyroid. Rather than offering any research to support this severe recommendation (because there ISN'T any research), the ""guide"" instead quotes the AMA and the American Thyroid Association, two groups that greatly enjoy the largesse of the thyroid drug makers who want to put Armour -- a far less expensive drug -- out of business. If this is the sort of ""unbiased information"" you want about the drugs you take, you might as well go ahead and just read the pharmaceutical company pamphlets. If millions of thyroid patients taking Armour Thyroid were to follow the advice in ""Worst Pills,"" the only thing that ends up for the worse is our health.

"1715","A bad choice of plot and character","It is difficult, nay, impossible, to like a book when all the characters are obnoxious, money worshipping parasites, and that is exactly what we have in this novel.  Out of the blue a godfather appears, a deus ex machina, who offers an idealistic lawyer, Clay Carter, more wealth than he can imagine or use.  Anyone with a brain would know that there has to be a hook within the bait, a very sharp, very large hook.  With apparent ease, this naive lawyer swallows the hook and makes millions and millions of dollars before he so much as senses that he is in deep trouble.  Enthralled with the gaudy toys and women that money brings him, he immediately loses sight of reality.  What a hollow and useless individual he is, as are those he hires to assist him and those with whom he associates in his lawyer world.Whether or not there are such individuals (Enron?) is beside the point.  They may exist, but I for one am not eager to hear their life stories.The atmosphere in which they live is boring, as are their conversations, their lack of values, their hobbies, their sex lives, and their comeuppances.  Somehow, even in their fall, they never lose all their money and they never quite realize what hollow individuals they are.Having read most of Mr. Grisham's other books, I expected better from him.

"1481","How....?","How some people gave this book a five star review is way beyond me.  First of all, I'd just like to mention that this nice book gives you schematic diagrams using symbols and other things without explaining them first! Secondly, if you want to understand electronics it can only be assumed that you want to understand the physics behind it! This book dedicates about a sentence to a paragraph to physics for each section.  Horrible! So basically, this INTRODUCTION to electronics doesn't do a lot of introducing you to anything! I'm on transistors right now, and I've spent days researching the physics of how they work on the Internet, and guess what? It's using schematics I don't understand, and yet again I'm going to have to do more looking on the net.  This book is not worth it.  Don't buy it! Just please, for your own sake, find another one.  Also, half the book is dedicated to projects.  That is, actually building electronic circuits! Why didn't the author just entitle this, ""How to build electronic devices"", then? It's beyond me! As far as explaining things are concerned, the book does very little, and assume you know more than you do.  Unfortunately I'm going to have to end up buying another electronics textbook, because this one is just horrible.  I was really wanting to learn something from this book, but it's just not happening.  For every chapter I've read on this book I've had to do research on the net, and I'm sick of it.  I'm on pg. 154, and I'm closing it.  DO NOT buy this book! I've already found a better book on amazon.com (just buy reading the Table of Contents!!!!!!!!!!) and I'm going to get it!",0

"1716","A Rather Plodding Morality Tale","I like John Grisham, but THE KING OF TORTS was a slow-moving disappointment.  Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel, which is fine, but he ends up putting the message above the story.   Grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits.  This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain, in agonizing detail, how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees.  Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers, and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients.   In the end, none of this adds up to an engaging storyline.  It doesn't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall.  Since I didn't care for this character, I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving.This novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone.   I personally dislike class action lawsuits, but I read novels for entertainment, not to validate my own political beliefs.   Although this book was decently written, I just didn't find the story interesting enough to recommend.For a better version of this story, I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr.",0
"1219","A little too disjointed","When I bought this book, I didn't realize it was mostly just a consolidated writing of Friedman's collumns in the Times.  I think Friedman is a great author with lots of great insights, but he isn't able to go into his ideas in depth as much as I would have liked in a bunch of detached 750-1000 word segments.  Since the sections are arranged chronologically, there also isn't the opportunity to tie the themes together.  If you really like Friedman, then it's worth a read, but if you are in it for just one, I'd read The Lexus and the Olive Tree first.  It is by far his best",0
"1309","Holy Moly ","This is the book Dan Brown's bestseller ""The Da Vinci Code"" is based on. Indeed, Michael Baigent et.al. have even sued Brown in court, charging him with plagiarizing their book. The ideas behind ""The Da Vinci Code"" have been exposed as completely bogus by many real historians. Obviously, this exposure affects ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" as well. This book is methodologically flawed. It claims that Jesus survived the crucifixion and sired children with Mary Magdalene. But if this happened, there should be ancient documents telling us about it. There are essentialy only three ancient views of Jesus: the Christian, the Judeo-Christian and the Gnostic. None of them includes the notion that Jesus married and had children with Mary Magdalene. It simply isn't serious to reject the ancient documents in favor of modern texts of questionable value, as Michael Baigent does. Of course, a conspiracy theorist might claim that the ancient documentation is lacking due to a massive cover-up. But such an argument, compelling as it may sound, is worthless to the historian, who must work with the real evidence, meager as it may be. A claim that can neither be proven or disproven is of little help. Besides, how many sects or cults have managed to keep their esoteric secrets? Very few indeed. There is always a defector or infiltrator somewhere. The idea that the biggest secret of all times was revealed by a confused French right-wing extremist only 40 years ago is very hard to take seriously. Indeed, the fact that not even heretical groups like the Gnostiscs claimed that Jesus had sired children, is good evidence against the claim. The Gnostics, after all, made all kinds of peculiar statements. But not this one. Why? Why are books like ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" and ""The Da Vinci Code"" so popular? Perhaps they say what many people want to hear. That in itself is somewhat damning, I think. For how many people want to hear the truth? ",0
"1389","Incredibily unpleasant read","I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries.  The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it.  It is a very unpleasant experience.The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill.  What I've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area.  I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story.  The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago.I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them.  This book, however, was truely repulsive.  I'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book",0
"1639","Book shows age","I was very disapointed by this book. After just finishing the 400+ pages book ""Bull! from Maggie Mahar"" which is an absolute ecxellent book about market cycles (although the more recent boom of 1982-1999), ""The great Crash"" was really hard to read. It totally shows its age (it was written more than 50 years ago). The language is hard to understand and some words seem weird in todays time. But its not just the language which makes this book not enjoyable. It is not written with much entertainment value, and the book I mentioned earlier shows clearly that it is quite possible to write an very entertaining book about the stock market. It also is very superficial, it doesn't go into much detail at all. It doesn't tell any examples of real people or anything which would make the book more readable. It lists names and companies without doing a good part of explaning why it lists them. Sometimes I was thinking to myself ""Please get to your point.""That book was probably a good read in 1955 while people still could relate to most of the names he lists. But now (2004) there must be better books out there about the Crash of 1929.I give it two stars and not one (you can't give zero stars) because it has some interesting facts. Overall I would NOT recommend this book. Try another one about this subject",0
"1600","Stick to Romance, Sparky.","Sparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing The Guardian. This book is awful. The storyline is weak and predictable, the dialogue is excruciatingly lame, and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry. There is virtually no romance, which is the reason to read Sparks' books. I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said, the way the dog seems to be human, and the predictability of the plot. This book is so poorly written and so lame I have trouble believing Sparks wrote it. If you want a good plot with romance mixed in, read Message in a Bottle or A Walk to Remember. If you want suspense, read Mary Higgins Clark or Agatha Christie; they do a far better job with it than Sparks does.",0
"1660","Steve deserves a better effort","Without question a book is needed to address the origin and history of late night television and Steve Allen's pivitol role it. Sadly Ben Alba's ""Inventing Late Night: Steve Allen and the Original ""Tonight Show'', is not that book. It is, largely, a poorly edited and self-contradicting pastiche of previously published memoirs by Allen himself combined with some excellent interviews with Allen's TV contemporaries. These interviews could form the basis of an excellent book by the likes of biographers Scott Berg (Sam Goldwin) or Neal Gabler (Walter Winchle).The opening chapter, which addresses Allen's dysfuntional up-bring, education and his early days in radio and TV sets the stage for the author's failure to create a full-blooded, well-rounded analytical portrait of Allen and his work. Alba draws here, almost exclusively and certainly uncritically, from Allen's memiors while combining these words with one quote from a childhood friend and two early reviews. Taking Allen and the reader's one independent witness at face value, Allen had a rootless, violent and unstable childhood. Given these negative conditions Alba gives  no hint of how, why or even if, Allen really remained attached to his drunken and generally unstable mother and her equally troubled extended family. The author gives us two brief stories from Allen's adulthood to demonstarte that the family ties endured. Actually, all the stories show is that Allen attended an uncle's funeral and very briefly troted his mother out once on his Sunday night show. How did this dysfunctional world of Allen's youth effect his two marriages and five sons? Why, after a childhood on the fringes of a perlious show business existance did Allen choose this same career field for himself? Alba doesn't even pose such questions about the boy's effects on the man. He just plows ahead in a haliographic haze. Throughout ""Inventing..."" Alba maintains this pattern of unquestioning acceptance Allen's words. No other witnesses are called, no other points of view are examined. Steve tells a story; Alba accepts it and edits it into his text. Why not read Allen straight?",0
"1150","disappointing","The whole concept of this book as well as the honesty of the undertaking: I'm not buying it.

"1522","P L E A S E . . . buy something else","Many reviewers on this site read TLGPE in the 70's, when we were young and impressionable. (I happened to be 13 when I read it.) If one could be sued for intellectual forgery, Lindsey would certainly be found at fault.Most of us, thankfully, have gotten past our fears that plagued our teenage years. After all, when we read TLGPE, we were young. We were searching and seeking. We didn't have all of the facts. There were wolves who knew this, and they preyed upon us. Many people who were older, yet still intellectually undeveloped, read this book and were moved to 'believing'.For most of us, our minds matured. We began to see the vast chinks in Lindsey's pompous Christian armor. We began to realize that fear is a weapon brandished by madmen, by people who use a subtle, gentle cloth of manipulation to control others.This is beyond dangerous. It is beyond extreme, as most of us have now found out.I love a good horror novel. I love a good 'true crime' thriller. But the fact that people read Lindsey's books and take them at face value is, perhaps, one of the scariest notions I have ever imagined.That, dear reader, is beyond horrific . . . and far more terrifying than anything you'll find in the bible or any of Lindeys 'books'. The only thing scarier is that Mr. Lindsey is still receiving royalties from an outdated, silly, contradictory and completely barbaric book penned over thirty years ago. Please don't be the next sucker. Please don't add this one to your cart.",0

Having read just about everything the man had written, ""Pulp"" was a hugely disappointing epitaph.  If you've never read Bukowski start with ""Post Office"" or the short story collections, but avoid this like the plague.  A bad book.  I can't think of a single reason to recommend it",0
"1705","Not One of Sparks's Best","As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention. Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue",0
"1242","Hate parade mixed with racism.","Hateful liberals once again undermine their so-called ideology by promoting the hatred of over half the US population. They claim to be tolerant and open-minded toward all lifestyles,religions, races etc... but that open-mindedness obviously shouldn't apply to people who disagree with them. Throughout the ""book,"" Moore also demonstrates his racism towards caucasians and thin people. If you like this book, I also recommend Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler. Both ""books"" are jam-packed full of hate.",0
"1616","Not age appropriate","Leaving the racism issue aside, this is not a book for small children. Even if everything turns out OK in the end, I'm not prepared to expose my children to issues of capital punishment and the drowning death of a small boy. Small children forget the ending and focus on the scary parts in between. Perhaps I'm a softie, but let's allow them to be children and not worry about being wrongfully accused of murder and sentenced to death by beheading. Just because it's a classic doesn't make it appropriate reading.",0

The writing is fine, as you'd expect from King, but there's nothing remotely hard-boiled or sexy in this novel.  (Don't let the cover fool you!)  It's simply the meandering story of an apparent murder that happened years before.  There are a couple of interesting hooks, but they certainly don't lead anywhere.  This one's for Stephen King completists only.",0

"1907","Hardly Engaging","I've read some of the other reviews, and I couldn't disagree more.  This book is not a page-turner.  I found myself skipping over whole sections of prose because they were boring and sometimes needless.  The story is straighforward.  Hardly any surprises.  Hardly any twists or turns.  Bad guys are always bad guys.  Good guys are always good guys.  There's no hidden agenda lurking through the story.  The blue rose is a natural anomaly.  The people who really want it -- the people willing to steal and kill for it -- are conveniently identified as people willing to steal and kill for the blue rose.  There's no ""mystery"" here really.  It's just a matter of getting to the end of the book",0
"1630","Her Weakest by Far","I've read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until I reached Hard Truth. After writing so many intellligent, suspenseful stories, Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. Murder's not nasty enough? How about the murder of children? Still not gruesome enough? Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture.Ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains, but really, who cares? The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. It's like bad language in humor--in general, it's just a cover for bad writing. In Hard Truth, Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness, in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter, the well-reasoned defense of nature, the lush descriptions of each story's setting. I found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable. I give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character (a recently paralyzed ice climber), but otherwise I'm sorry I spent my time and money on it",0
"1010","Some good info among the political commercial","When Professor Polk describes the sweep of history in Iraq, he is at his best, but the book often descends into a political diatribe that is neither appropriate nor grounded in the facts.  Much of the political ranting is supposition, marring what would otherwise be an interesting and informative work. The ranting gets especially tedious towards the end.  My advice, read the first part and skip the last half",0
"1453","OMG!  This is so bad...","I've read most of the books written by Greg Iles. I liked them all except Dead Sleep, which by the way was much better than this one!Anyway, despite Dead Sleep, if I see a book by this author I haven't read yet I'd grab them right away without further thinking because I enjoyed the rest of his work very much. So, when I bought Sleep No More I was prepared to stay up all night because I was certain it would be thrilling. WRONG!The whole Mallory/Eve/Cole/etc thing is just not believable at all even though I set my memory and imagination open as the author suggests. I still laugh when I think of the explanation of how Mallory gets into another person (she has to have sex and have a mindblowing orgasm). I should give Greg Iles some credit for this idea, a stupid one, but creative nonetheless.As for the characters, I was so appalled by the paranormal plot that I couldn't care less about any of them. I read The Quiet Game and liked it, but the appearance of Penn Cage was just so blah because he's like a cameo in this book and didn't have a character development nor adds anything to this book.In conclusion, I would not recommend this, especially to those who liked other books by Greg Iles. Nevertheless, I'm going to continue to purchase other books by him because I enjoyed his other works very much and strongly believe he is one of the best fiction writers.",0

Oh yeh, if you save early you will be a millionaire in like forty years...zzzz.   Ok, it did help me by reminding me about the interest rates in banks.  One idea was to put the emergency funds in a money market account which offers a higher interest rate than a regular savings account.  Upon reading this, I decided to do this and doing this made me realize the dismal .2% I've been earning on my saving account.  And not realizing the latest craze started by ING, all the other banks offer an ""online savings"" account which offers 5% compare to the dismal .2%.  I immediately switched!  Other than this part of the book, it was boring",0
"1792","Not Christie's best","Hmmm. I'm struggling to give Agatha Christie such a low rating. She wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into. Not quick reads, but very methodical with lots of character development. I don't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow-moving chapters, but I always do it knowing that I will be rewarded with a great ending. Christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the ""who, where and why"" were finally revealed in the end. I was shocked again at the end of this book - not because I didn't know who the killer was, but actually because I already knew who and how. I tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious. Very disappointing. Christie books I would recommend instead - ABC murders, And Then There Were None and Murder of Roger Ackroyd",0
"1765","Snore is Right","I found this book to be a vaguely interesting dissertation on what the SHAM (Self-Help Actualization Motivational) Movement is, and maybe even on why it is, but no help whatsoever in giving me any tools for argument against it.  I thought, sucked in by the interesting cover suggesting brain-washing in such a humorous way, that the author might have a sense of humor herself and I'd find her book absorbing intellectually and on other levels as well.I would read a page or a paragraph or two, close the book, and nod off.This is such a fascinating area, it could be the basis for a really fascinating book, but ""Self-Help, Inc..."" left me feeling I needed to go to a self-help group to deal with the density of the verbage.

It sometimes read as a fiction novel where he was alittle too much superman to be belivable.I also found it very strange that he very seldomly refered to other members in the squad, i do recognise that sniping surely is lonesome work but still, it was like nobody left an impression or if he held back with intent.Another thing that is getting tiresome is that is always the russians that are the bad guys doing grizzly things, but he didnt stand for a minute to think what his own country had got himself involved in.Still a good read but these factors didnt allowed me to be gripped by the story as other memoirs have.",0
"1563","What Went Wrong With the Writing of This Book?","In the post 9/11 world in which this book, subtitled ""The Clash Between Islam and Modernity in the Middle East"" was published, it should not be surprising that the reader would anticipate a discussion of the factors that led up to that awful day. This, however, is not to be found in What Went Wrong?Instead we are treated to a cerebral discussion of various and sundry esoteric minutiae. We learn, for instance, that, ""A distinguishing characteristic of Western music is polyphony, by harmony or counterpoint. This begins in its simplest form with the choir, in which matched voices sing different notes in a planned sequence to produce a combined effect; then comes the keyboard instrument, matching the ten fingers of the two hands, following different routes in a common purpose; and finally, the musical ensemble, from duets and trios to the full orchestra"". While this is all well and good, and may even be mildly interesting on some academic level, it is hard to understand how it plays into a discussion of ""The Clash Between Islam and Modernity..."" that has led to the precarious times in which we live.Or, on another note (harmony? counterpoint?) we learn that Robinson Crusoe was translated into Arabic by Butrus al-Bustani and published in the late 1850's. Big deal!What we don't learn anything about is the rise of militant Islamism. There is no mention of Wahhabism or how this fundamentalist Islamic movement contributed to the rejection of modernity. The Muslim Brotherhood also is not to be found in the index, nor is there a mention of Sayyid Qutb, or his writing of the incendiary manifesto, Milestones. Furthermore, there is not a single reference to al-Qaeda, though Usama bin Laden does appear, albeit seemingly as an afterthought, in what appears to be a hastily added Afterword.So what went wrong?Beats me..",0

The authors show they are very knowledgable on the subject, but they fail to analyze the information they present.  The reader is left to interpret the meaning of details and ponder why they are included.  The authors also use repetitive examples that become tiring and ineffective.  The only minutely important information is presented in the topic sentences of each paragraph, and the book can be reasonably well understood just by reading the introductory sentences.  While this book could be a treasure house for someone researching the relationship between manors and their respective villages, the average reader's attention is never captured.  Students, beware!

My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up. ",0

I know this will outrage some Patterson readers but I'm not much of a fan of Alex Cross who frankly I find boring as hell. As mediocre as Patterson often is as an author, readers should beware, London Bridges is especially bad. The novel reads like an abridgement, moving at a frantic pace without ever generating any suspense. The premise is ridiculous - super criminals with silly names join forces to blackmail world leaders (sounds like the plot for an Austin Powers movie - without any of the humour). Patterson is not remotely qualified to enter the international terrorist thriller market. An author who churns out 3 or 4 novels a year doesn't have time to do the kind of research that is needed to produce a plausible terrorist thriller. The twists at the end - ""he's the wolf - no, he's the wolf - no, she's the wolf - no...."" by the end, I just didn't care. James Patterson has written some decent crime novels but his fans should beware. Quantity, not quality seems to be Patterson's priority these days. London Bridges is a mess from beginning to end.",0
"1366","A Formal Analytical Review","""OF PARADISE AND POWER"" - BY ROBERT KAGAN""Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus"" - apart from simply raising a few eyebrows, this line by Robert Kagan author of ""Of Paradise And Power"", has not only caught the attention of many but managed to stir up a wave of discussions among the politicians and elites concerned with cross-Atlantic relations. Kagan's thought provoking book became extremely popular and received international acclaim for its analysis of the deteriorating US-Europe relationship, not to mention its catchy and striking phrases systematically introduced throughout the slender yet captivating book. Kagan introduces multiple chapters in his book, in order to deconstruct the key underlying issues which he claims are causes of the ever widening divide between US and Europe. In the chapter ""The Power Gap"", Kagan starts from World War I to understand the aversiveness Europe displays towards military and wars. He argues that while both the World Wars weakened Europe tremendously; they helped the US emerge as a super power. He further elaborates on the might of the US in the chapter that follows - ""Psychologies of Power and Weakness"". Kagan explains how lack of power can not only affect psychologies and ideologies, but change perspectives as well. He claims Europe's paucity of military power compels it to not only tolerate threats but ignore them all together and at the same time try and counterbalance the US force by constructing a world which is governed by economic and soft non-violent methods. This chapter culminates into ""Hyperpussiance"", a chapter in which Kagan discusses intricate details of Kosovo and Bosnia, highlighting Europe's failure and America's effectiveness in handling the situation. He finally presents his central argument in the chapters ""The Post Modern Paradise"" and ""The World America Made"" where Kagan states, ""Europe's evolution into its present state occurred under the mantle of the U.S. security guarantee and could not have occurred without it."" Casting doubts on Europe's intentions, Kagan centers his argument on the growing self-centered policies of Europe and questions the validity of cohesive terms such as `west' in his chapter ""Is It Still `The West'""? Finally, it seems Kagan provides a solution to this insolvable problem of the US-Europe divide in his concluding chapter, ""Adjusting to Hegemony"", by simply stating one line - ""the task for both Europeans and Americans is to readjust to the new reality of American hegemony"". This extremely small book, as compared to the issue it addresses needs further analysis and some close examining. There are many issues to be addressed in Kagan's brief analysis and one might not be completely satisfied with certain claims, reasonings or the manner in which such a grave and sensitive topic is handled. While there is a tone of underlying bias (in contrast to the general opinion of a well-balanced view that the author holds), Kagan manages to miss out some crucial facts and figures, not to mention present stark paradoxes, and the essay lacks sufficient citings.      To start with, let me point out the contradictions in Kagan's arguments, the presence of which highly undermines his claims, leaving the reader in a dilemma unconvinced of either argument. Kagan claims, ""Europe's relative weakness has understandably produced a powerful European interest in building a world where military strength and hard power matter less than economic and soft power...rules of behavior"" (pg.37). He goes on to say, - ""Since Europeans lack the capacity to undertake unilateral military actions, either individually or collectively as `Europe,' it is natural that they should oppose allowing others to do that they cannot do themselves.""(pg.38) in contrast to ""...Europe today has the wealth and technological capability to make itself more of a world power in military terms if Europe wanted to become that kind of world power"" (pg.53-54). Kagan contradicts his own views, stating many times that Europe is militarily weak, nor does it have the capacity to build up its forces yet at the same time, puts forth an argument of Europe's capabilities of increasing its defense spending and military might to match the US.     In the chapter, Psychologies of Power and Weakness, Kagan's one claim contradicts another which is made in the next chapter as the reasoning for both his claims seem to be absolutely tangential. He first explains Europe's greater tolerance for threats is due to its weakness and the fearful past, which it has suffered from. He then metaphorically explains it by giving the example of a man with a knife and the same one with a rifle having different interpretations of the word `threat' when confronting a bear (pg.31). But again Kagan himself feels Europe can become a military power as and when it wishes to, when he says ""They could easily spend twice as much as they are currently spending on defense if they believed it necessary to do so"" (pg.54). So this forces me to ask a question, would one be mauled by a bear if one could produce a rifle to prevent this misfortune? So isn't it quite possible that Europeans feel safe, not because they ""...enjoy the `free ride' they have gotten under the American security umbrella over the past six decades"" (pg.54), but rather because there was and is no real threat at all?    With the use of phrases such as ""The Axis of Evil"" and ""Rouge States"" (pg.30), which Kagan uses to describe Iraq and Iran, not to mention his references to `Weapons of Mass Destruction' (which he uses as a pretext to the war in Iraq), which still seem to be elusive for some reason, he seems to perplex me by blatantly ignoring his own creation. While Kagan maintains that Iraq was a threat and the US perceived it as one while Europe did not, he might want to explain as to why, in 1997, he (Kagan was the Director of the Project for the New American Century) signed a document which justifies American occupation of the Middle-East, irrespective of threats from Iraq or Iran. ""The United States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security. While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein...From an American perspective, the value of such bases would endure even should Saddam pass from the scene. Over the long term, Iran may well prove as large a threat to U.S. interests in the Gulf as Iraq has. And even should U.S.-Iranian relations improve; retaining forward-based forces in the region would still be an essential element in U.S. security strategy given the longstanding American interests in the region.""(pg.17 - Rebuilding America's Defenses - *1) This forces me to conclude that either the author has resorted to `cherry picking' of evidence or he suffers from selective amnesia.    Some of his reasoning, analysis and analogies seem to be too nave. When explaining military action, one cannot justify it by saying, ""When you have a hammer, all problems start to look like nails"". The author speaks about the nation's (US's) willingness to go to war simply because it has the ability and the capacity to do so. Without discussing a need or providing concrete reasons for the use of aggression, the author seems to be content in justifying use of force, simply because one has it. One important aspect Kagan leaves out in his analysis are the political and economical aspects of the ongoing US-Europe feud. While I have discussed some economical aspects later in the review, one must note that Kagan does not mention the Kyoto Protocol (apart from Clinton's negotiation of it (pg.45)). The US withdrawal from the Protocol had created serious problems and divisions between the two giants (www.climnet.org - *2). While there were many other issues that further fanned the growing fire, disagreements over the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty for example, which Kagan conveniently sweeps under the carpet, needed to be addressed if one is discussing transatlantic relations (www.bbcnews.com - *3, 4)    For a book which covers issues from the pre World War II decade (occasionally going back to ancient philosophy) to the present issues, 72 citations, from which many are simply extended explanations (for examples, see supra notes- 19, 20, 22), seem to be alarmingly low, especially with the absence of some important ones and not to mention, certain citations which wrongly allude to historical facts. Kagan mentions, ""As `some' Europeans put it, the real division of labor consisted of the United States making the dinner and the Europeans doing the dishes"" (pg.23), yet he does not refer to any source for this cynical statement. He says, ""The vast majority of Europeans always believed that the threat (if any) posed by Saddam was more tolerable than the risk of removing him"" along with other alleging statements like, ""The rehabilitation and reintegration of Saddam Hussein's Iraq is precisely what they(Europe) sought"" (pg.44) , and again gives no source for the origin of these beliefs. Strangely, he supports one of his claims by stating in his supra note.20, pg.30, ""for that matter, this is also the view commonly found in American textbooks"". One might not generally expect to see such puerile purporting evidence in a scholarly analysis of transatlantic relations. Kagan at times jumps back to Athenian times and has injected strong philosophies in his essay. He mentions a number of times how Americans see the world from a Hobbesian perspective while Europeans are followers of Kantinian policies. Kagan seems to have overlooked the fact, that though Hobbes had described the state of nature as that of ""all against all"", the only reason Hobbes justifies a sovereignty is to ensure peace on earth. Kagan conveniently cites Hobbes (Hobbes theory itself was flawed as later philosophers termed it as `Hobbes Dilemma') to justify American aggression, but no where in Hobbes' theory is aggression justified by the sovereign (Leviathan - Ch.17).     There are some conclusions Kagan draws which seem to be beliefs of an American idealist living in a world where politics is as pure as religion. He concludes that while the US was providing ""free security"" to Europe after the Cold War, ""...America's great power and willingness to assume responsibility for protecting other nations..."" (pg.34) has given Europe the opportunity to build up economically. Kagan further asserts his point when he says, ""Given America's willingness to spend so much money protecting them, Europeans would rather spend their own money on social welfare programs, long vacations and shorter workweeks"" (pg.54). These are inaccurate presentations of facts, which are more of subjective, bias ideologies. I would like to put forth two points in order to accentuate the conspicuous fallacy of these two statements. First, America's interest in Europe was not to provide it with security whether before or after the Cold War. One must not confuse the fact that measures taken to restrict the Soviet advance was purely for selfish motives, rather than for the benefit of nations which were under the watchful eye of the communist empire (Kagan himself acknowledges the fact when he says, ""With the check of the Soviet power removed, the United States was free to intervene practically whenever and wherever it chose...""(pg26)). Second, when Kagan acknowledges that Europe which has a ""$9 trillion "" economy is in a comfortable position to support its welfare programs along with increased military spending; attributing the fact that Europe spends more on welfare, as he calls them ""free-riders"", results in a faulty analysis.When I had mentioned earlier that Kagan chose to omit and ignore certain facts, the example of the Balkans, which the author has cited many times in his book would seem most relevant. Kosovo is one of the primary issues he discusses to bring forth US benevolence and European incapacity. ""American involvement in Kosovo or Bosnia was not based on calculations of a narrow American `national interest'...While Americans had a compelling moral interest in stopping genocide and ethnic cleansing,... the US had no `national interest' at stake in the Balkans""(pg.50), this is how Kagan sees it. Indeed stopping genocide was a concern, but was it the only concern? While Milosevic had very much agreed to station NATO troops in Kosovo to stop the conflicts, none seem to have been interested in his offer; they rather wanted complete access and control to all of Yugoslavia. The Rambouillet Accord, to which the Contact Group added an Appendix B on the last day of the conference held at Paris, one must note was the primary reason for rejecting NATO troops, as it demanded Yugoslavia to surrender its autonomy and sovereignty. Yet, he does not mention of Milosevic agreeing to station NATO troops in Kosovo (http://wsws.org *5).     Some thing missing from Kagan's entire book are the words ""Latin America"" and ""Africa"". As seen above, Kagan believes America was spending its money protecting Europe and Europe alone from all the threats around the world, before and after the Cold War. But what baffles me to quite an extent is that not once does Kagan mention about any American intervention in Latin America (official or not), Africa or the Far East for that matter. Those who are well aware of the world around them, will be aware of America's support for dictators and other corrupt regimes throughout Latin America and the far East, Indonesia for example, which were for self serving purposes alone or is it that the author is implying that the Latin American and African countries were a threat to Europe, hence the interventions and no mention of them? (A complete timeline by Steven Kangas can be found on multiple sites *6, 7, 8)     There is one severe `defect', as I put it, which undermines the entire argument of this book. Kagan's tunneled vision approach, which refers to the word `power' only in terms of military strength and capabilities, ultimately results in a false dichotomy, which is the stumbling stone for his thesis. Kagan believes the world and in particular, Europe, is left with two options, that either they follow the US or be a tacit audience. The reason he reaches this conclusion as I previously put it, is due to his convergent view. ""Rather than viewing the US as a Gulliver tied down by Lilliputian threads"", says Kagan, ""American leaders should realize that they are hardly constrained at all, that Europe is not really capable of constraining the US"". He reinforces this claim throughout his book (see pg- 33, 37-40, 59, 62, etc). The author's abysmal ignorance about hard-hitting, highly valid and relevant facts has rendered severe blows to the validity of his claims. Kagan has committed serious errors here, by ignoring Europe's strength, not military but political and economical indeed. With a population of 456,953,258 (the CIA Fact Book *9) and still growing, the EU, leave aside Europe, cannot be simply overlooked or brushed aside as a dead competitor or a bygone culture. Europe is economically strong enough to trouble the US as and when it wants to, the recent problems over the genetically altered meat, banana dispute, steel industry debacle, Airbus-Boeing clash and many more, have all proved that Europe's economic strength is much of a concern for the US.  While I must point out a rank deletion, I believe this is `the' single factor which is capable for arguing against all of Kagan's thesis and arguments, and that is the American Economy. Not once has he mentioned the deteriorating state of American economy (2001), even though problems did exist when he wrote this book. He seems to be blissfully ignorant and persists that America can sustain its exorbitant defense spending, ""...the US can sustain its current military spending levels and its current global dominance far into the future"". Strangely, the growing inflation rate, rising unemployment, stagflation, trends the economy was showing of heading towards a recession, were I believe dismissed as myths by the author (for statistics see - www.bbcnews.com; http://wsws.org *10, 11). Also, Kagan's final solution suggest that, ""The obvious answer is that Europe should.... and build up its military, even if only marginally"", leaves me with a conundrum. Is Kagan implicating that Europe has no military at all or is it that he wants to begin a new arms race, this time Cold War II? Kagan must understand he is writing this book for international publics and not simply those, whose ideologies are in tandem with his. Hence, I doubt most would disagree that the world should get into an arms race here, as we all know, there is no stopping to this evil if it once starts.While I have already discussed the effects of trade and economics (which Kagan ignores) on the US-Europe relation, there is something I must point out before I end this review. Kagan, rather conveniently digresses of the topic, which is transatlantic relationships, to justifying US hegemony in a neo-conservative fashion. While most Americans themselves would probably not agree with Kagan's ideology (as the public opinion and faith plummets - see polls from various news sources *12), leave aside Europeans or rest of the world, Kagan writes almost 15 pages to justify it. This was a rather disappointing conclusion to his book, where he thinks the only solution to the ever widening divide is ""Adjusting to Hegemony"". When Kagan says how many (statistics seem to abandon him) Americans believe that by advancing their interest, they advance the interest of humanity, he sounds exuberantly jingoistic and to drive the point home, he quotes Benjamin Franklin as saying - ""America's cause is the cause of all mankind"" and again I must bring to the author's notice, the recipient of these remarks is an international audience, which is diverse, has its own culture and heritage, religious beliefs and ideologies and has no reason to believe why their culture or beliefs are inferior to any other.  An author of his stature must realize that it is transatlantic relationships and not a primary grade bully that is being discussed. While he seems to take pride in saying that America has a ""go it alone"" attitude (pg.39, 99), it does not abide by the UN Security Council (pg.40, 99), takes action unilaterally irrespective of international laws (pg.45, 61, 99), is justified in adopting `double standards' (pg.62, 99), he fails to fathom the gravity of the current day (or rather the day when he wrote this book) situation and the growing unpopularity of American foreign policy around the world. While he sees Europe as an obstacle in the path of America's imperialistic goals, a neutral observer would be more than justified in pointing out that may be it is the US that hinders progress and efforts of the EU to establish a world which respects international laws, human rights, collective public opinion and most of all - peace. He fails to give an impartial, if not a complete solution to rid the world of this wedge as he weakly concludes his essay by saying, ""...a little common understanding can still go a long way"". While many have nothing but words of praise, as a one line summary by Francis Fukuyama calls it - ""Brilliant"" (a co-architect and signatory of the Rebuilding America's Defense Project) and according to Dr. Henry Kissinger, [against whom innumerable charges of human right violations have been levied, who ironically, Kagan terms as a ""quintessential realist"". See - http://en.wikipedia.org(for cases) *13; http://www.thenation.com(for list of crimes) *14] the book is a ""seminal treatise"" which would ""shape the (US-Europe relation) discussion for years to come""; I do not particularly endorse it it. As I have already put forth immense supportive data to show why the book lacks a concrete argument, sane reasoning or supportive evidence, though its lucid prose, easy comprehension and its articulate linking makes it a good read, it barely digs deep into the problem or the solution, apart from scratching the surface, `the military surface'. Indeed the book did create waves in the political arena, which was probably due to its impeccable timing, but I cast serious doubts on the claims that it would be ""discussed for years to come"". *1   - http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf*2   - http://www.climnet.org/news/march2001.html*3   - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1383385.stm*4   - http://212.58.226.30/1/hi/business/2052405.stm*5   - http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/apr1999/yugo-a14.shtml*6   - http://www.atrocities.net/ *7   - home.att.net/~Resurgence/CIAtimeline.html *8   - www.serendipity.li/cia/cia_time.htm	*9   - http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ee.html*10 - http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/dec2000/us-d30.shtml*11 - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1263211.stm*12 - http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/index.php*13 - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger*14 - http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?bid=3&pid=17",0
"1246","A doctrinaire view of biology","Most books that set out to explain why organisms behave as they do describe observations of behaviour on almost every page. The books of Richard Dawkins, whom Rose selects as his special target, illustrate this well: readers can reject all of his interpretations while remaining fascinated by the purely factual information that they contain. How one can hope to convince anyone of the truth of a theory without supporting it with abundant facts? Yet hard biological information is extremely sparse in Rose's book. There is a great deal about what he thinks of other biologists' opinions, but almost no observations from behavioural biology. Nonetheless, in his preface he aligns himself with the practising biologists ""who spend a significant part of every working day thinking about and designing experiments"", dismissing Dawkins and Daniel Dennett as ""people who either no longer do science or never did it."" What a pity, therefore, that he chose to include so little of the experimental basis of his ideas in his book. There are a few vague remarks about how chicks behave, and that's about it. ",0

"1375","Horrible, horrible book.","As someone very interested in urban exploration (especially in the subways) I wanted to check this book out upon hearing of it. After reading many of these Amazon reviews though, I opted out of a purchase, and took it out of my Bronx library instead. Thank goodness as I only wasted valuable time, and not any money.This book is a sham. It is obviously mostly fiction. And it's boring fiction at that. The book is divided into chapters, each chapter a new ""adventure."" I read the subway one first, where the ""explorers"" take the 6 train around the loop at the end of the line, to see the City Hall Station, which opened in 1904 (NYC's first station) and closed in 1948. The station is located on the loop of the 6 train, that makes the southbound trains go back up north after the last stop, Brooklyn Bridge. First of all, anyone can go on this ""adventure."" Just stay on the train at the last stop, Brooklyn Bridge, and that's it. Despite the author's attempt to make this sound risky, no conductors walk through the train to see if anyone is on (like they really care), just sit down. The author created some ""European tourists"" that inadvertantly stayed on the 6 after the last stop, and the author even tries to create some mystery by saying ""are we on the wrong train?"" Well, unless all those huge ""6"" signs that are lit all over the train are difficult to read, then you probably got on the correct train. The author also fails to mention that the MTA used to give public tours all the time through this station (and others like the 18th street on the 6 and more) but stopped after 9-11. This chapter was a joke.I started reading the other chapters, and saw they were no better. I then started to breeze through the book. One thing that is very obvious - no photographs of the adventures are in the book at all. This, despite the fact that on page 67 the author states, ""Josh takes out his camera and snaps away at every pipe and puddle...""  But no photos of their ""adventures"" are in the book. Why? Because it's fiction. There are photos of what they are supposed to be exploring, sure, that's easy. There's even one pic of one of these clowns hopping some fence somewhere, ooo. Buit no pics of the actual ""adventures."" I guess ""Josh"" lost all those pictures when he went to CVS to have them developed.The funny thing is, you can save yourself a lot of time by just going online and viewing pictures of these things for yourself.

That even when  Ella decided to follow hairy Franco -a paraguayan stud- not because his looks, not even for this foolish thing called love, but because  he smelled like luxury and power in a faraway land; I still found it a joyable read,  but right when she arrived to her privileged life of  ""querida""  of the most powerful man in Paraguay and began to have one baby after another in tumultuous times,  The News from Paraguay became boring and I began to skip entire paragraphes until I got to a previsible end.Based on true facts, the life of a Paraguayan dictator and his irish  mistress; Tuck, who confessed that she never went and wasn't interested in ever going to Paraguay (i think she finally did) can't even get the spanish names right: Mauel, instead of Manuel, Rosaria, instead of Rosario; Iez, instead o Ins. What's the deal with the ?Maybe I lost something in my not so good english, but I still can't get why,  a so so novel like The news from Paraguay, can win a National Prize",0
"1098","Shockingly overrated!","Our book club read this last month and not a single member had anything good to say about this book.  As the facilitator, I was surprise by the consensus since we usually have at least one or two members who love the monthly selection.  The writing is disjointed to the point that Ms. Krauss loses her reader.  Then when she introduces the potential that many of the chapters might just be imaginary interactions between the characters, the reader is left extremely frustrated.  I really cannot imagine how Ms. Krauss' novel has garnered so many stellar reviews",0
"1881","Where has the magic gone?","PROS: 1. John Corey is still a funny, memorable character.CONS: 1. Very little suspense. The author's use of a doomed character's point of view--switching to third person--to tell the reader all of the hows and whys of the main villain's Dr. Evil-esque plan (""FIRE THE NUKE!""). Then, after we know everything, we get plopped back into the first-person, investigative head of Corey, who doesn't yet have the story solved. The result is predicatable and tedious.2. The don't-look-behind-the-curtain (gratuitous?) use of the Ted Nash character, who makes a brief appearance at the end...despite having died in NIGHTFALL...and, uh, THE LION'S GAME. Why is Ted's appearance so brief here? Well, he admits to screwing Ms. Mayfield. Naturally, Ms. Mayfield opens fire and fills Ted with bullets. Presumably, Ted's dead for good now. 3. The politics of DeMille's novels has been present in other books, but it's never been this catty. Why is the nuke kook a right-winger? (Hey, why not?) I should have known when the jacket cover said the book ""will challenge you to question everything you thought you knew about your leaders and your country."" The only thing this book has made me question is how anyone can seriously be more worried about conservatives nuking L.A. and San Francisco than the real terrorists out there...the ones who want to slit throats and post the footage on the web.  4. Continuity problems from how the last book, NIGHTFALL ended...Corey and his wife seem way too disaffected by it all. Yep, they are bothered by 9/11, but they are both working their same jobs, apparently having gotten over the whole sickening coverup (witnessed via videotape) that the ""accident"" of the TWA flight 800 was really caused by a missile. There is passing reference to this, but not much. Apparently, a guy like Corey doesn't do much soul searching. He just keeps going to work. In realilty, it's hard not to notice that DeMille still doesn't know how to deal with the storytelling hole he got himself in with the last book.Corey is really all this book has going for it. And, while in his capable hands the world will be saved from kooky nuclear schemes from kooky Republicans, he can't save this book.I think I'm done with DeMille, for better or for worse",0

"1806","Deeply Disappointing Dexter","I was not a huge fan of the first book, but the concept was interesting and some times a series gets better with each book. This may not be the case here. While it is not as forehead smacking dimwitted as the first, it is has it's moments of unbeleiveablity. How can Dexter be so attractive that women throw themselves at him, and such a good pretender of being human that he can be oblivous when women like him? The only women who was not attracted to him has been his foster sister, and I kind of think it might be only a matter of time. I also dislike how every person who is his foe ends up dead or out of commission. Are they going to introduce a new character to be ""on to him"" every book? This is not only frustrating but it shows that the author is completely incapable of developing any character or relationship longer than a few pages.",0
"1013","A book intended to deflect attention from Arab racism","This book is essentially about how culture is used to promote the interest of stronger, imperial powers.  Said condemns intellectuals in the West who in his eyes are ""agents of exploitation"".  Yet Said himself is an agent of racism.  A Pan Arabist, he always supported Arab unity and ""Islam"" at the expense of non-Arab and non-Moslem peoples.  Said directs and manipulates the Western taste for self criticim, and all that does is deflect the world's attention from Arab and Moslem attrocities committed against Christians, Kurds, Jews, Israelis, Coptic Christians, non-Arab Sudanese, etc.  Thus, reading Said, you would never realize that Sadam Hussein's poisoning of the Kurds has never been condemned by one Arab intellectual or leader.  This is because a racist prevalent attitude in the Arab mind is that the entire Middle East should be Arab.  This also explains the attitude towards Israel, a country that is predominantly non-Moslem and speaks a Middle Eastern language other than Arabic.The pity is that Said himself is a Christian, yet he never spoke on behalf of Coptic Christians in Egypt, or the right of Christians to practice their faith in Saudi Arabia and probably other places in the Arab World.  He is facilitating the overall aim of PanArab Nationalists by distracting the West from what is happening in the Arab world.  For a better understanding of relations between the West and Islam, I recommend books by Bernard Lewis, such as ""The Moslem Discovery of Europe"" and the ""Jews of Islam"".  I also recommend books by the Egyptian scholar and Jewish refugee Yael Bat Yeor, such as ""The Dhimmi"". ",0
"1444","S is for Slow Read","Normally, I find it hard to put a Sue Grafton book down once I get started. Not the case with ""S"". I did not enjoy the plot about Violet and her abusive husand.  The main character Violet was too much of a stereotype - boobs, red hair, just a boozing slut over all.  I didn't get the whole thing about her brother and why he disliked her. The ending wasn't clear either. I did like the development of the relationships with the young girls exposing jealousy and how it ruined relationships over several decades. Most of the characters just weren't that interesting overall.I missed her interactions with Rosie the restaurant owner and her neighbor, the handsome 80 year old baker Henry. Usually, there is an interesting man in the picture too - not here. I would vote pass on this one.",0
"1701","Tediuous, repetitive, and altogether poorly written","Sheppard's attempt to capture the ""American youth angst"" failed miserably. Instead what he created was a novel that felt more like a chore to get through.  I never developed any connection or understanding of the characters.  Each chapter seemed to stumble into the next, with the end as predictable as the next expletive Sheppard was going to use to give his protagonists a hard edge.  You'd do better saving your money, driving to the nearest mall, and find the kid in the Anarchy T-shirt looking sullen, because it appears that is all Sheppard did in this work.  Phew Stinker-rooney!  ",0
"1279","Not one of Quindlen's best","This book was easy enough to read, it just wasn't what I expected from Quindlen.  I usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating, in this book I really did not find either of those traits to stand out.  The back-and-forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing, and sometimes I was in the middle of a paragraph before I realized this paragraph was a jump to the past, whereas the previous paragraph was present time.  Although I got used to that writing style, I always found it annoying.  The storyline itself never sold me either: a typical, young ""sew-your-wild-oats"" boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the ""perfect"" father. I just did not find such an occurrence likely.  And, as a mother myself, all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm. Anyway the whole story seemed far-fetched and disjointed to me, and a disappointment especially since I have been a Quindlen fan for many, many years",0
"1579","good plot but bad details","This book started out good but went downhill quickly because of poor research and virtually NO understanding of computer systems by the author. I don't mind authors skipping over technical details of computer systems to keep the plot moving, but if the author decides to provide detailed technical descriptions of encrytion codes, firewalls and hacking techniques, those details must be fairly correct. In this case, the technical details were so wildly implausible that I finally had to stop reading. The part where hackers were gradually forcing their way through a firewall to access NSA data were particularly difficult to read without becoming distracted by the absurd details. The NSA almost certainly doesn't have computers with highly classified data connected to the internet (through any combination of firewalls) but if they did, they could simply disconnect the internet connection if they were being hacked. Besides all that that, the characters were cliched and not well developed.This is all too bad, because the plot was interesting and I would have kept reading if the technical details were either accurate or just avoide",0

"1552","Sad Disappointment","The title is a misrepresentation.  This is not a handbook for driving a Porsche quickly or professionally.  I bought this book because in 2 months I am going to drive my rear engined 993 on a F1 circuit.  I have no circuit experience, and cannot get any coaching or any circuit experience in the country I live in.  Since this is a rear engined car which I have little experience with I was particularly wanting some tips particular to rear engined cars.  There is nothing in the whole book which is particular to driving Porsches or rear engined cars.  The only reason I will not throw this book out is because it has some interesting 1960's and early 19970's Porsche racing pictures (poor quality black and white though).  Also to be fair there are some good racing stories. He is undoubtedly a very impressive driver having been successful at the highest levels in rallying and sports prototype endurance racing.  A better title would be ""My Porsche Racing History"".  If you want a book on fast driving I would highly recommend Ross Bentley's ""Speed Secrets"" in place of this book",0
"1809","Profiting from the Christian Man Shortage","There is no doubt in my mind that Josh Harris is a good person, who sincerely wants to help people, particularly young Christian women, who are especially affected by the vicissitudes of the modern dating scene. However, he doesn't seem to offer much honesty about why this book has been so popular.  Either he's guilelessly uninformed or deliberately avoidant: inexcusable in either case, considering how influential this book has become. Is it because it offers the best possible advice on how to navigate the most clear and direct path from singleness to marriage?  No.  For the vast majority of singles, the approach described in this book will be too rigid and contrived to be workable.  Few couples have actually gotten together this way.The real reason why this book, with its overwhelmingly female readership, has sold so well comes down to one main reason: there is a SEVERE SHORTAGE OF SINGLE CHRISTIAN MEN, as documented in CampuslifeCollegeGuide.com male/female ratios, and the Barna Research group website which estimates the shortfall to be in the MILLIONS.  Christianity Today recently identified the gender imbalance as being the issue that ""rises to the top"" for Christian singles.Because Christians are encouraged to look at circumstances as springing from ""God's plan"" for their lives, many of the surplus women faithfully avoid doing the math, but certainly feel the lack of male attention.  Unfortunately, this often gets boiled down to some kind of ""passive Christian guy thing"", but it probably has more to do with the complacency that accompanies the abundance of women: which is the defining masculine climate wherever there is a man shortage, whether it's New York City, Post-war Russia or your local mega-church.  It's not so much a lack of male leadership, but a lack of males.And so the idea of courtship appeals to the romantic longings of single Christian women frustrated by what they perceive to be a lack of initiative taken by single Christian men, who they greatly outnumber.  Since reading Christian books about relationships can be as titilating as any romance novel, many of these women will pour over every detail looking for the one piece of advice, the one thing they can change about themselves that will make a difference.  Which means they stay on the spiritual self-improvement treadmill, fuelling a Christian singleness industry with its own slogan ""The Gift of Singleness"" that refuses to tell them the truth about the Christian man shortage that is the greatest cause of their prolonged singleness!  Of course, their lack of contentment (an innate response that tells you that things don't add up) is something they are told to repent, ironically by pundits who themselves will not repent of how they profit from this symbiotic relationship.  But as long as these women can be convinced that their discontent is caused not by unnaturally protracted singleness that's the result of the Christian man shortage but their by own spiritual failings, there'll always be a market for Christian self-help books like this one.  Pure genius!What's more, there are ""unintended consequences"" that can go along with Harris' model for ""courtship"" that he doesn't really address:1) Because all masculine initiative taking must be based on a guy's intention to marry the woman, it makes asking a woman to do anything a BIG DEAL to him. This can have several sub-consequences: (a) It creates a lot of anxiety for guys in terms of their decision-making and rejection-risk (getting turned down for a date is bad enough, but imagine having your ""potential marriage proposal"" crash and burn!) (b) It fosters prolonged crushes, as stakes get so high with the guy investing all kinds of time and energy in figuring out that this is ""the one"", he might not ever do it (c) Ironically, it can boost up the guy's expectations in terms of a woman's looks. Because the guy has to have everything worked out in their heads (that yes, this is the kind of woman I want to marry) lot of guys end up not bothering to spend time with girls who don't LOOK like whatever their ""wife prototype"" might be. Guys who date and don't make a big deal of ""a date"" are more likely to ask out women they never thought of marrying and possibly end up getting married anyways (In ""How to Get a Date Worth Keeping"", Henry Cloud explains how couples will admit that their spouses weren't really ""their type"" when they first met). 2) It keeps people from the humbling reality check that dating provides. Serial dating (as practiced in Latin American countries, where a guy will ask out tons of women, get turned down by most of them until he has a ""short-list"") teaches you where you stand with the opposite sex. You ask your way down your ""ladder of options"" until you find your equal (likewise for women, in terms of dealing with the facts about who's asking and who's not). With courtship, a man or woman can nurse an untested prototype of what they want in their heads for years. The idea that it's better not to have any previous flames to compare them to is FALSE. You're better off being compared to their last girlfriend/boyfriend (a real human being with chunky thighs and all) than with the evangelical Angelica Jolie/Brad Pitt that has filled their imaginations since adolescence! 3) It reduces interactive opportunities that promote the acquisition of social skills needed in a romantic context with the opposite sex. It reinforces the pattern of psycho-social-sexual immaturity you commonly see in Christian singles circles. 4) It's unfair to the woman to have some guy spring a potential marriage proposal (which is essentially what courtship is) on her without any prior notice that the guy (who's had a head start on working out his feelings) is romantically interested. Most Christian women seem to need some time to progressively get used to the idea of having a date with most of the guys who would realistically ask them, let alone entertain the thought of marriage. 5) It also heightens the significance of anything the men do when interacting with the women in their circle, who inevitably end up reading too much into their behavior and expecting too much whenever any nuance of interest gets expressed by a someone they like. Kind of like, ""he's a nice, sincere, Christian guy and he wouldn't be spending this kind of time with me if he didn't think of me as marriage material, right?""...not always so. If we are to stand back and take a look at it, the whole courtship redux really hasn't gotten off the ground: it works for too few people at this time. Maybe the world has changed too much, or perhaps there are other issues today's Christian singles face in the mating game that need to be dealt with first: such as the confusion about ""the gift of singleness"" and the shortage of men. I would recommend Debbie Maken's Getting Serious about Getting Married: Rethinking the Gift of Singleness for an alternative view of courtship that embraces the ordinariness and universality of marriage, instead of this moldy oldy.",0
"1198","Sappho and sex.... and magic??","I have very mixed feelings about this book and can't say I enjoyed it all that much. I love the story of Sappho, what little is known of it, and so I picked up this book expecting to see a historical fiction novel cut with realism, research, and certainly the unavoidable necessary lewdness of the celebrity of Lesbos. But monsters? Centaurs? I mean, the story of Sappho's life is not the story of The Odyssey and for the life of me I don't understand why  author Erica Jong decided to give her readers a combination of Greek heroine and Clash of the Titans. Once I was able to get past the fantasy elements, I realized that I was not being pulled into the story on its own merits. There wasn't enough emotional dimension -- for all her travels, we're shown pretty landscapes and scary oceans but we don't see enough of a real character. I read Sappho's poems in college and the talented mind behind those words is NOT present in this book. I'm not saying the book is without its good points. Jong has certainly done a lot of research and her enthusiasm is many times contagious. But I found the whole bit a little odd... like picking up a book about Cleopatra and seeing her encounter dragons, unicorns, and the goddess Isis. If Jong had written about Ariadne, this all might have worked. The blend of fantasy just didn't add up to a palatable meal for me",0

"1706","A complete disappointment","It is difficult to believe that such a slow and dull book could be written about such a compelling subject.  The reviewers who have lamented the short, choppy paragraphs that irritatingly jump from one scene to another, without benefit of full explanation or connection, are correct to scorn the overall poor writing that makes up this book.  I had to read some paragraphs several times and even then didn't understand what I was reading.  It was nearly impossible to picture most of the action in my mind, as it was mostly just a jumbled collection of facts and anecdotes that rambled on and on and on.  The description of the fire itself drags on chaotically for fifty tedious pages, which incited one yawn after another.  The book lacks any sense of focus and the author uses a very poor choice of words in many instances.  For example, the narrative is littered with sentences like: ""She made for the east exit...""  Okay, fine, but did she run, walk, crawl, hop, skip, jump, or fly to the east exit?  I just don't know what to picture there.  The word ""made"" says nothing descriptive and is therefor about the worst word that could have been chosen.  This type of problem occurs on every page of the book.  I haven't read anything else the author has written, so I hate to be so critical.  I wonder, however, why his editor didn't send his manuscript back to him with thousands of suggestions.  I felt as if I was reading a very hastily-prepared early draft.  I have read many gripping books about disasters and survival situations.  This just isn't one of them.  Compare ""The Circus Fire"" to ""Into Thin Air,"" ""Heart of the Sea,"" ""Batavia's Graveyard,"" or ""Ordeal by Hunger"" and you'll understand what I mean",0

It appeared to me that Mr. Brands' intent was to analyze the life of this great man strictly from his critic's point of view.

What he misses, however, is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control.

The plot was good, but moved slowly.  I am typically not drawn to Danielle Steel books and probably with good reason that I never seem to like them very much.

"1934","Not very satisfying at all.","I'm a pretty diverse reader, so I decided to give this one a go.  It started out somewhat interesting, but then just sort of made me keep saying, ""Okay...what's the point here?""  I really like Ninah, the main character, but I keep waiting for her to break free from the chains of this commune she lives in.  I guess the ending is somewhat a symbol of her doing this, but I closed the book wondering, ""why did I read this?""  I grew bored with a lot of the goings on in this community and found many of the ""punishments"" just ridiculous.  I'm pretty open when it comes to accepting different religions, but this was just way out there for me.  Ninah's relationship with her Nanna was the neatest one in the book.  I'm glad I'm finished...now I can move on to something more fulfilling. ",0

It has 51 6""x8"" pages with huge font and too many cartoons.  It successfully defines what is good and bad posture, but does not provide excercises to improve it (it simply states to ""practice"" good posture).  There are much much better alternatives.

It was not even interesting as fiction.",0

"1272","A book that will make you laugh and frighten you","Mr. Galbraith is smart, accomplished, and learned man who knows what is best for all us.  His view of a good society differs from past visions of societal utopia.  Rather than a completely coercive state directing the  actions of its citizens to some hirer calling, Mr. Galbraith aims to be  `practical' and just further defines the third way.  Nonetheless, his  proposal of what makes a good society is not the classical liberal view and  it is more attuned to the European model of society.  Many of his proposals  are so silly you won't take them seriously.  But sadly, he is quite  serious.  For example, Mr. Galbraith states that in a good society everyone  should have a rewarding life.  Of course, he never defines the standard by  which society should judge whether or not a life is rewarding.  Neither  does he address what one should do if their life is un-rewarding and what  the obligation is of society to fulfill that vision of a rewarding life.   And, of course, who is the `rewarding life judge' and does this judge have  the authority of the state to take something from someone (who has a life  that is deemed too rewarding) for someone who has life that is too  un-rewarding.  Mr. Galbraith fails to convince the reader of the  practicality of his proposals and ends up straddling a line between  socialism and capitalism, and saying nothing new",0

Also the other suggestion was to install a pull out swinging triple door pantry system.  Oh is that affordable?

However, Secrest in her drive to capture the ""essence"" of the man has so mangled the story of his life and career that reading her work is more chore than delight.  To say the book is disorganized is to deal in serious understatement.  But worse than that are the inaccuracies, especially when she writes about Duveen's customers.  Just for starters, apparently she didn't recognize the need to differentiate between John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and his father (or maybe she didn't know there has been more than one JDR!).  You won't learn much from this tome that you don't know to begin, and getting through it will be a struggle. ",0

Tanya Holland is a beautiful Black woman, but I feel has gone too far out of the way to create ""innovative and different"" recipes so much that they are not appealing and certainly should not be categorized as soul food.  The price is outrageous for the handful of recipes that were chosen for this cookbook.  I collect african american/soul food cookbooks among others.  If you are really into soul food cookbooks and what they really represent, your money would be better spent on ""Essence Brings you Great Cooking"" by Jonell Nash, ""The Ebony Cookbook"" by Freida DeKnight or ""The Black Family Reunion Cookbook"" by the The National Council of Negro Women.  If you are interested in healthier soul food try, ""The New Ebony Cookbook"" by Charlotte Lyons or ""The Family Dinner Quilt Cookbook"" by The National Council of Negro Women.  If you are interested in diverse, cultural flavors, I would recommend Vertamae Grosvenor's cookbooks or ""Iron Pots and Wooden Spoons"" by Jessica B. Harris.  I have collected over 50 african american soul food cookbooks.  They cover the gamut.  That is why I can give an honest opinion on Tanya Holland's book.  I just wish that she would publish an african american cookbook that the average African American can relate to.  One that would be useful to families in their everyday cooking. ",0
"1832","Great--if you are a rich capitalist","Don't buy this book if you do not have to for a class. I did. As with most textbooks, it is a ripoff. Mankiw got a 1.4 million - MILLION - dollar advance for it. Who do you think pays that. What kinds of things does this text teach? Well, it contends that unemployment insurance and labor unions cause unemployment, because people do not want to look for work when they can fall back on the governmnet. This is the biggest load of hooey in the world. I guess when you are a rich, tenured professor it is quaint to see those people lining up who just lost their jobs because business major read your book. And minimum wage? Kills off jobs.Mr Makniw is now the chairman of the presidents council of economic advisors. What a job he has done. Worst jobs record since Hoover. Of course, if the capitalists honchos had their way, everyone else would be working for $2.75 an hour. Read this book, but go to the grocery store first.

"1573","Coma This Is Not","Chromosome 6 has a great premise: what happens if medical technology accelerates to the point that scientists can create genetic doubles for people; doubles who serve as living organ reservoirs for possible future organ transplant needs-a sort of biological insurance policy? How much would people pay for this service? How far would they go to protect it? What are the moral implications?Robin Cook comes full circle, returning to the themes of his 1970s novel, Coma. Coma is the novel that first made us aware of the dangers of corporate medicine and greed; of the subtle but relentless destruction of the long-standing relationships patients had with doctors, and the dignity those relationship once preserved. Now, a quarter century later, Robin Cook is shown to have been eerily prescient as technology has caught up to his nightmare.Chromosome 6 is a very believable scenario of a technology designed with the best of intentions being corrupted for the sake of profit. In this novel, there is mystery and murder; medical sleuthing and exotic, international sets. There are a host of characters whose paths will intersect at some point-the set up is brilliant and we read with eager anticipation-but...this novel is so poorly written that I cannot believe it has Robin Cook's name on it. Though not high literature, Robin Cook's novels have always been tight and suspenseful, with believable characters and settings that seemed real. The characters in Chromosome 6 are as flat as road kill, the action as watered down as a glass of coke left in the sun until all of the ice has melted. Turn a page and the story just ends...what? That's it? Are you kidding? Did Robin Cook really write this? I don't think so.",0
"1720","Chloroform in Print","Mark Twain called the Book of Mormon ""chloroform in print"" and he wasn't kidding.  It is by far the most boring read I have encountered (I could barely get through it).  I am a woman of faith - faith in God and faith in Christ and I don't know how anyone could believe this rubbish.  PLEASE, anyone who is taking this at all seriously - do some research on the church.  Ask some hard questions (you will likely get a rehearsed answer, but it's worth a shot).  Joseph Smith was accused (and fined with a misdimeanor) of being a ""glass looker"" - hired by a man to help him find buried silver mines started and left behind by the Spanish. He would use ""magic stones"" that were placed in a hat to tell him where to find the location.  So convenient that he later found ""gold plates"" and used what he called the ""Urim and Thum"" (which, by the way are actually gemstones that were carried by the High Priests of Israel in biblical times) to translate these plates (he describes them as stones he looked at in a hat).  There are SO many myths that are told by members of the church ""most men were SO distraught at the thought of polygamy"", the age issue of Joseph translating the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith's actual role in polygamy (which really should be called polandry - when a woman has more than one husband...  11 of Josephs 33 wives were actually married to other men first and then married to him, having NEVER divorced the first husband - what's up with that???).. etc.. and the list goes on and on...I am not disputing that Mormons take care of their own... that they are often kind people who have good hearts, I think that is all wonderful and if you want to join their church for those reasons that's great! Just PLEASE do some homework first and don't just rely on the ""power of prayer"".  There is a reason that Utah is the [...] capital of the USA (I'm sure every one of those people ""prayed"" about that big business decision - it can OFTEN be mis-intrepreted). ",0

"1568","Tough language but few verifiable facts","In a world desperate for health solutions, the uneducated masses flock to purported cures and aids that have  not met the tests of either scientific or medical validity.  Alkaline water is one of those potholes that the unsuspecting customer encounters.Careful research of this book and related topics finds that the real reason alkaline water is popular is that in pregnant Oriental women, it is believed that the use of alkaline water increases the probablility of a boy rather than a girl being born.  Hence the seven(7) percent utilization of this water in that part of the world.  Elsewhere, mycocardia problems with controlled animal tests using alkaline water have been known since 1996 but are suspiciously avoided by the Japanese organizations which promote alkaline water.Common sense nutrition tells us that if one is concerned about acidic food intake, then the use of alkaline foods with alkaline fibre and neutral pH liquid is the answer.  Alkaline promoters would have you dilute your sensitive blood pH with  high alkalinity thus inducing hematological problems which may put  you in the emergency room as my medic(1985 Nobel Prize recipient) clearly points out.You might as well drink battery acid he said, the result will be the same stress on your blood pH.  Here is a medic who is not an expert in water but in internal medicine cautioning against forced dilution of blood pH.He continued by saying that when that much alkalinity is added to the digestive system, the very low pH which naturally occurs in the disgestive tract is neutralized and food is not metabolized properly.  The various amino acids which are essential in the metabolic process are no longer effective and food putrifies and nutrition suffers.The alkaline promoters, including this book's author have been sniffing glue in a closed closet and are simply out of touch with  even the very basics of body chemistry and metabolic processes.Read the book for entertainment and not for education and utility in your daily nutritional program",0
"1360","This book lacks","Sorry for the sarcastic title. I've read most of this book. I'm still reading the last chapter which is actually the most hopeful chapter.I'll start with what I liked. Harris lays out some good suggestions on handling the pyhsical aspects of a dating relationship (or courtship if you get caught up in semantics)However, Harris offers nothing else except a rudimentary courtship model that involves physical boundaries and guarding against things moving too quickly.I think this is good wisdom, but the book completely lacks in many other apects of pursuing a relationship. He talks very little about communication skills. Also you won't find much on personality traits or compatibility. When I began a relationship with my girlfriend I read this book. I don't regret reading it, but it lacks in a lot of areas. Part of this is due to the fact that I don't know what credentials Joshua Harris has to make his claims. He is not a Phd, or a relationship or family counselor. He had two substantial romantic relationships in his life. One with the girl who inspired him to write his first book, and the other with his current wife. When it comes to relationships, I would hardly call Joshua Harris and authority on the subject. He has no more experience or wisdom that the average person who would pick his book up off the shelf.I support the crux of what Harris talks about. I respect the fact that him and his wife Shannon waited to their wedding day for their first kiss. The book is chivalrous and romantic. It is a hopeful book. But it paints only a partial picture of how to persue a relationship. If you are into reading relationship books, just be sure this isn't your only resource.",0

I wonder what Stewart will write about in the sequel, since Milken has taken on a life of philanthropy basically unrivaled, and certainly contributes more to this country than most. Milken's creation of a liquid market for junk bonds allowed credit risk to be redistributed throughout the capital markets, effectively creating more capital, more jobs, and more wealth creation. Anyone up and coming in IB, or looking to inform themselves of the 80's capital movement, please at least check out some other perspectives on the era. Note: These comments don't apply to Boesky or the arbs who were doing nothing but breaking the law. I would argue a strong distinction between Milken and most of the other characters in this book",0

"1700","Discombobulation","This was a terrible disappointment.  More of a memoir than anything about book-collecting, it was so disjointed it is hard to say what it was about or what the point was.  There seemed to be no context or fabric to the book.  There were, however, HUNDREDS of references to obscure authors, actors, film-writers, magazines and books.  There were pages at a time where I was completely lost because I had no idea about whom the author was speaking, but he wrote as if the person was well-known to the reader.Baxter leads the reader around the world from his beginnings in Australia, thence to Britain to the US and ending in France.  Again, there is no context.  He would flip from a reference to the obscure artist, to an anecdote about himself or some bookseller or collector and then perhaps mention how he had acquired a book.If viewed as a book about collecting books, you will not learn much.  If viewed as a memoir, there was little that was interesting about the author's life and there was precious little about his life other than acquisitions.  There were a very few nuggets about what makes a book valuable or diminishes its worth to a collector, but they were too few and far between.If you could not tell by now, I can not see much reason to read this book.  I think Mr. Baxter flattered himself to think that either he or his collection would be of general interest",0

"1493","Not very well reasoned...patently unoriginal","Like most critics of Objectivism, Mr. Walker focuses his criticism on Ayn Rand's frailties and idiosyncrasies rather than the principles of the philosophy she founded.  My disappointment in his book was immediate and I have to say it's as unoriginal a piece of writing as any other critic I've read.  His cynicism drips from almost every sentence and his contempt for all things Objectivism is obvious to anyone who takes ideas seriously.  I cannot recommend this book even to those interested in contrasting views of her approach to philosophy; this book was written for those of like mind to the author...whatever mind they can be said to have.The body and scope of work done by Objectivist scholars who've never met Ayn Rand now ellipses her work - both fiction and non-fiction - and the work of her original core of thinkers.  To characterize the movement as a cult may have had some validity in the years prior to her death, but only in the most remote sense of the word.  Right now the ranks of Objectivism are swelling with intelligent people who differ in background AND in opinion.  Mr. Walker's principle mistake is looking at Objectivism as something that was born exclusively from the mind of Ayn Rand...something Miss Rand herself would disagree with.  Objectivism is the logical continuation of a line of thought that views mankind as a reasoning animal...a line that extends back through history and begins (explicitly) with Aristotle.  Those (like Mr. Walker) who dismiss it on the basis of Miss Rand's personality and the culture of people that grew around her in her lifetime are truly missing an opportunity to enlighten themselves.  There is no doubt Ayn Rand is a polarizing figure; my advice to those inclined to read Mr. Walker's book is to read Miss Rand's books as well.  Particularly her non-fiction.  I'm not a real big fan of her novels or fiction in general - it was Rand's non-fiction works that first inspired me to study her philosophy - so my first suggestion would be ""Philosophy: Who Needs It.""  I enjoyed her novels, but I enjoyed her non-fiction more",0

"1057","Sadly disappointed","""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and ""The Queen's Fool"" are two of the best books I've ever read--and I've read a LOT of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. They were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. So whenever a new book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. ""The Virgin's Lover"" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. One reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. Anthony Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the case with Gregory. I know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when I'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. They feel forced, constructed. I'm going back to Trollope",0
"1874","Is the writer a real believer ?","To say Christianity will die is to say that one can see the end of the world. Purely craziness. Christianity will live as long as the world exists. What is died is the faith for many Christians, what has been changed is our faith (by money, pride, and selfishness) and consequently, our church and our societies. What dominants many US and European Christian churches is a worldly Christianity, a Christianity affected by the materialism, and world-view. The exact thing that Jesus repeatedly condamned. I feel extremely sad when I can see pasters and evangelists earn 6-figure salaries, live in luxury houses, air-travel in business class, or socialize with social elite. I feel extremely sad when I see young theology students without born-again experience and spiritual life become pasters and preasts. Jesus have given us great mission: to preach gospel to every corner in the world. But money, pride, and selfishness have consumed the hearts and sole of many Christians and today they love the world more than they love Jesus. Are they still Christians? Of course not. To say Christianity needs change is purely nonesense. Only person see himself greater than Jesus would say something like that. What needs to be changed is ourselves, not Christianity. Because we have embaked a wrong way, following the world and not following Jesus. ",0

I did not, however, shed one tear during Message in a Bottle.In English class, I always learned to ""show, not tell"" when writing.  When that is your rule of thumb, you'll write a moving piece of literature, even if you're not completely skillful.  Sparks is the master of telling without showing.I'm honestly baffled by all the good reviews it gets.  The story is somewhat engaging, but with no payoff.  But the work is filled with passages like (and these are from memory; if I picked up the book to look for verbatim examples I'd have to type the entire thing), ""He went to the refrigerator, opened the door, and took a beer.  After opening it, he sat down on the back deck.""  Or, ""Though she was overweight, she moved quickly around the table.""  ""She got out of the shower, dried off, and put on khaki shorts and a white cotton shirt.""  Have you read enough yet?I'm new to the romance genre.

"1678","Now that the DailyKOS crowd has finished posting","I've always been a big believer in ""attack the message"" (if you don't agree), don't attack the messenger.  The reverse has been almost standard practice of the Left when they can't refute the truth, facts and common sense of conservatives.  Which is close to 100% of the time. So I have to be very careful not to copy the Left when I write as a fifth generation Kansan and having lived all of my life, thus far, in the same ""upper-middle class"" suburb Mr. Frank seems to so despise in his first and only book.   But his book was so filled with errors, personal opinions disguised as facts and mislabeling of events, people and general culture, as to make it a book of fiction; not one of fact. He stated himself he had every advantage presented to him early in life but he chose not to take advantage of them.  He relishes being a victim and seems to mostly be upset that he wasn't born into a poor family of migrant laborers.  Perhaps born as Ms. Condoleezza Rice?  She is certainly a good example of someone held down by evil conservatives and not permitted to excel in life (not).  Living in, and exposed to, the surroundings of his childhood, it appears to me his life's goal was to become a professional victim and a loser in life where the deck is stacked against you from birth.   He's, so far, at least succeeding in that!   Being an accomplished loser.   What a goal! His only ""accomplishment"" was the writing of one book that could only be believed as fact by disciples of The DailyKOS.   Having written his fictional book of what life is NOT like in Johnson County, Kansas and how he was stopped cold at every turn of life's losing lottery, he really has nothing else to say.   Perhaps he can now survive as an invention of the Left writing the same type of fiction over and over (as he just did for the NY Times).  He must be a very unhappy person.  It seems most liberals are.  How sad.  The only real obstacle they have in life is seen in their mirror each morning.  That's it no matter how much they deny reality. He seems like an intelligent young man who had everything going for him.  What a waste of talent.   Now, he's just another ""victim"" doing his best to convince everyone else they too should just give up as they can't win in life no matter how hard they try.  As I intimated, I'm sure glad Condoleezza Rice ignored people like him!  I just wish people like him were fewer in number and that more ignored their delusional vision of reality.Checking in from Kansas, he is a ""one book wonder"".  ",0
"1273","Christian fundamentalism dramatized","Even the avid ""trekie"" reader of the Star Trek science fiction novels, movies and television series must suspend disbelief, when he finds Captain Kirk saying ""Beam me up, Scotty.""  But the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort, when he reads in this book that Jesus will effectively beam millions of true Christians up to heaven in the world-wide ""Rapture.""  Though the characters and their roles are fictitious, the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer. The story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass Rapture event, and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions. In the September/October 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs Walt Mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions.  Instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform.  Billy Graham's biography by Strober notes that they criticized Graham's ""new evangelism"" for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems. Yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the ""Tribulation Force"" or as exemplified by Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority.They are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the United Nations. Mead notes that it is no coincidence that the Left Behind novels show the Antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the United Nations.The U.S. Statistical Abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially, while evangelicals and liberals - e.g. Southern Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists - and Catholics are continuing their per capita declines.  Such data and the reported popularity of these Left Behind novels indicate fundamentalism's growing appeal in reaction to contemporary American society.I see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the ""left behind"" in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern American society, and as conservative Christians who believe it is better to stay behind.  And in not just a few respects, they may be wise to do so.Thomas J. Hickey",0

I like the Shabby Chic style and since she's the person to get inspiration from on this style, I immediately bought this book without hesitation.

"1402","Awkward writing makes a bad story even worse.","Middle-aged Gracie is a typical Hollywood wife, right down to her botox injections and designer wardrobe.  When her husband dumps her after almost ten years of marriage, Gracie finds herself without love, without friends, and most importantly, without status.  (But at least she's still got the money!)Actually, most of what I know is from the dust jacket since this book was too torturous to finish.  The plot is predictable and uninteresting and is littered with so much name-dropping that sometimes it's hard to follow.  The characters are taken straight from Stereotype 101 and are so badly written that they're impossible to relate to.  The writing is ponderous and lumbers along awkwardly, lacking polish, wit, or interest.  Especially irritating is Grazer's insistence on using Gracie's name as much as possible.  For example:""Gracie thought about it; they'd never been to marriage counseling.  Gracie had gone to counseling in the beginning of their marriage - there were many issues to overcome.  More or less her personality issues - the fact that Gracie had too much personality.  Gracie said and did pretty much what Gracie pleased, in the beginning.  Before Gracie learned The Way of the Wife"" (p 38).I lost interest after about 20 pages, plowed my way through 40 more, then gave up.  It's very obvious that this is a poorly-veiled autobiography (Grazer/Gracie) and that as a Hollywood wife, Grazer DOES have the connections and clout her protagonist lacks or this book would never have been published.Definitely not worth your time",0
"1344","HIGHLY implausible plot lines","My first Grisham novel, and it reminded me of why I seldom read fiction.  The plot has numerous barely-believable twists, the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility.  Said lawyer then drives from Memphis to New Orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid's mere suggestion.  Absurd!  No attorney in his/her right mind would do such a thing!The ""storybook ending""just prior to the boarding of the FBI Director's private jet is implausible as well as gratuitously sappy.  Also, I highly doubt that the FBI Director gets personally involved in many -- if any -- such cases.Thankfully, I paid only 25 cents for this book in paperback form at a garage sale 2 weeks ago.  Given that it's written at about a 4th-grade reading level (and I have no children), it'll make good fireplace kindling next fall.First Grisham = LAST Grisham",0
"1535","See the WONDERFUL (very different) 1937 movie instead ... ","Sadly, this thrilling sea-yarn from 1897 is nearly unreadable today.  Between the seafaring jargon - which must have delighted boys of yore - and the unfathomable dialects, it can take ages to puzzle out a page.  Some of the anecdotes related by the good seamen of the schooner ""We're Here,"" which has picked up over-privileged Harvey Cheyne when he was washed overboard from a luxury liner, I could not grasp the point or moral of.  My husband has read all the Patrick O'Brian series, so I asked him to puzzle out a representative story, that of Counahan the Navigator, and after spending 15 minutes reading me a few pages aloud and filling me in on the few terms he understood, he said, ""Honey, I see what you mean.""   One can get the general gist, but it's best to read through fast, then go back and see if any of it makes any more sense.  	For example, when educated Harvey says, ""Why can't we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories?"" his pal Dan answers, ""Allus can, till we begin to dress daown.  Efter thet, the heads and offals, 'u'd scare the fish to Fundy.  Boat-fishin' ain't reckoned progressive, though, unless ye know as much as dad knows.  Guess we'll run aout aour trawl to-night.  Harder on the back, this, than frum the dory, ain't it?""	I got my B.A. in English, and I would rather tackle Joyce's ""Ulysses"" than an unannotated version of this book. 	So why did I bother?  A few days ago, a friend showed us the DVD of the 1937 movie, starring Spencer Tracy and Lionel Barrymore, on his big screen home theater, and it was thrilling and very moving.  The movie is quite different from the book, though, but it may give some incentive to check out for oneself how Kipling crafted the story, as it did for me.  But dear teachers, PLEASE, do not subject students to this particular title unless you are going to spend the semester on it and are willing to turn them off classic literature forever!

"1140","Crops, Crops and More Crops","I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, ""Collapse"" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK",0

I kept hoping that Meghan would somehow be redeemed, but that did not happen.  She is really not very likeable.

"1477","No original material, as far as I can tell.","I agree with a previous reviewer who found fault with the way the story was told.  There is no excitement in describing the stages.  They are just wrapped up all of a sudden.To me, it did not seem like the author did many interviews of his own.  It seems like he just watched the Tour de France and retold what he saw on the broadcast.  His supposed ""back-stories"" which should be really interesting, all seem like a recap of the mini segments during the Tour broadcast that let you know more about the participants.There is just nothing that reaches out and grabs you, and makes you want to keep reading.  I finally quit it after the poor description of the day in the Pyrenees.  That is one of the most exciting stages of the race, and the narrative was so wooden",0

"1884","Scholarly but unpersuasive -- and heavy with details","While I found this book interesting and informative when it dwelled upon the personalities and contributions of the physicists who discovered and explored the field of quantum mechanics prior to WW2, I found two problems with the book as it entered the war.  First, it spent too much time, at least for me, on the details of minor episodes and players.  In this sense, I might have appreciated the treatment had I been a scholar researching the field - but I wasn't.  Hence, I often found the reading dull.  Second, I found Powers' ultimate thesis - that Heisenberg purposefully delayed the German atomic bomb program - unpersuasive.  It appeared to me that Powers often strained his interpretation of the facts to make them conform to his thesis.  For example, when reviewing Heisenberg's ""Farm Hall"" statement in August 1945 that two tons of U235 was required to make an atomic bomb, Powers suggests that because Heisenberg articulated the appropriate lesser amount a week later,  and because he purportedly suggested at an earlier date that a bomb could be the size of a football, his ""two ton"" statement was a purposeful ""error."" Equally persuasive, if not more, is the simple thought that Heisenberg did indeed grossly overestimate what was required, thereby prompting him to tell Speer in 1942 that a bomb was impractical. This is not to say that Powers is necessarily wrong.  I simply believe that based on the facts he presents, the issue remains debatable",0
"1063","This book is Bedlam!","The back cover to this book was intriguing, and captured me immediately. The writing, however, was so plodding, so inconsistent, and so non-sequential that it was painful to get through to the end. This is aside from the fact that this man appears to be socially inept and unable to manage his affairs from day to day.  I can't believe that this book made it past the editors.  In one paragraph Jon Katz tells how Rose is the only dog for the job of helping him capture his runaway herd of sheet, and in the next he says that Rose is too young to herd sheep.  In one paragraph he can't live without his wife, she gives his very existence meaning, and throughout the book he describes how he lives apart from her in order to...what was it again?  Oh, right, herd sheep!  At one point the dog he loves the most is also the one he can't connect to and finally gives away.  And then can't stop visiting, even though everyone knows how confusing that would be to a dog. And why is he wondering why the world looks at grown men funny when they hang around too much with teenage boys - there's a reason, Jon!If you care at all about literarure, stay away from this book",0
"1392","Pseudo-feminist tripe","I fail to understand all of the hoopla about Susan Sontag. While I have only read a limited selection of her work, in these essays, ""Against Interpretation"" being the ultimate example, Sontag emerges as a simple-minded, arrogant ignoramus. In her utterly unreasoned invective,  Sontag ignores (or is just unable to understand) two critical facts. First,  some works of art and theory are difficult to understand (in varying  degrees) without the help of interpretation. Sontag's flawed analysis of  the supposed ruination of the works of Kafka by interpretation demonstrates  that not only is she among this crowd, she has clearly reached new and  unheard of misguided heights. Second, Sontag ignores the fact that works of  art in other languages cannot be understood in translation without the help  of interpretation and criticism that demonstrates the extent to which  aspects of a certain culture are imbedded in the original language. This  couldn't possibly be clearer than in poetry. Weinberger's excellent  ""Nineteen Ways of Looking at Wang Wei"", which adroitly considers  the subject, hadn't been released when Sontag published this essay but it  probably wouldn't have made a difference. What was she thinking? The only  good aspect of the essay (and why I give it 2 stars instead of 1 or zero)  is the fact that it has given me ample opportunity to win arguments against  individuals who are flawed in their thinking enough to enjoy Sontag's  writing",0

There is another Patricia Kennealy running mad through the streets and shouting about high schoolish love fantasies that exist only in her mind. I thought one Patricia was enough. But after reading this book, I am faced with the frightening realization that there are TWO of them!Also, what I find very disturbing is that this version of Patricia may be even daffier than the original version. After reading just 6 or 7 pages of this hallucination horror show it was evident to me that the author is suffering from a case of Patriciaitis and a dose of Kennealyism.By the 40th page I was searching for my red slippers so I could click them together and get back to Kansas.

"1572","I liked her at the start, but wanted to slap Julia by the end!","I have never actually thrown a book across the room in frustration - and I love books, so this is drastic!  Spoilers ahead - please don't read on if you haven't read the book.  I managed to (somehow) get through the first book, 'Wideacre', which I disliked - whilst I adore the rest of Gregory's novels, so this was hard for me - and grit my teeth and tried to read this book, the sequel as I'd bought it and it looked more promising.  It was 'marginally better' as one reader put it, than the first, but a very depressing and frustrating book indeed.I was getting very angry and frustrated after the second half of the book - as many other readers have highlighted, Julia's consistent inability to stand up to Richard made it impossible for me to like her anymore.  I quite honestly wanted to slap her to wake her up from that dreamy state she was in!  Because I wanted so much for Julia to be with James - who I liked a great deal.  I was so depressed after everything went wrong and she didn't marry him... ah, because I was expecting the usually very clever Ms Gregory to surprise me and have a twist at the end and say, aha!  She does get her true love in the end and she and Ralph get rid of Richard and although it's not happily ever after she learns to grow a backbone and be the very first female heir to Wideacre.The rape scene with Julia and Richard was very violent and far too detailed and I think it may be difficult to stomach for anyone who has ever been in an abusive situation like that, in fact, for anyone at all.  I don't want to get into the tricky area of abortion too much, but I really did feel strongly that Julia should have gone to Ralph for help when she concieved the child with Richard.  This was a child of incest and rape - and she knew in her heart there should be no heir for Wideacre - they were all simply too inbred and it needed to end somewhere for nothing was going right.  Clean slate, so to speak.  Yet she gives the child away - then in her final letter asks James to find the child?!  What?!  And I was expecting perhaps a deformed child, after all this inbreeding (I mean this child is the product of parents who are brother and sister AND grandparents who are brother and sister!!!) but she was perfect and beautiful.  I was hoping the gypsies would keep her and she'd never be found again.. but alas, the Lacey madness will live on...The perfect end to this book would have been a nice twist.  Gregory could have made her very good point about inheritance rights and the lack of power women of Beatrice and Julia's era had by Richard being killed by Ralph, then Julia inheriting the land - baby Sarah is adopted out to the gypsies and never seen again and Julia either lives as a widow and runs the land or (this would have been lovely - I bet all the girls have sighed over James a little, didn't you?  he was a little like the handsome romantic leads in Austen's books) James forgave her - for they had both made mistakes and Julia's was not intentional nor her fault (I was practically screaming at her that it wasn't her fault - and she gets it in the end, when it's too late!) and they marry and have 'normal' children - or perhaps none, they just learn from their mistakes and respect each other, and make a fresh start for Wideacre.There were so many allies that Julia had - she was a sweet girl and I liked her - I wish that I could have shaken her though, I got so mad.  So many people in the village offered their help - this trap she was caught in with Richard could have been avoided - ahhh... SO frustrating.  I will not be reading the third book in the series.  I shall go back to reading Gregory's more historic novels (A Constant Princess is one I haven't read yet and it sounds excellent).  I wouldn't recommend this one",0
"1492","Dissapointed","I admit I was impressed by the table of contents of this book, and I admit I had no previous experience with the subject, but sure with the 'real life' of support services for a database company.

Kuffners book might have 365 activities, but it really bad organized.  I am a first time parent, so I need some help/guidance; thsi is why I baught this bbok.  There is nothing to guide me on which activity is for what age group, so I don't know if an activity is for 18 months or 24 or 12 months- ie amI challenging my toddler, am I boring him or amI providing him with the right fun activity for his age??? Some of the activities are too obvious- it seems like the author wrote down anything she could think of just to fill in 365 activities in the bookl and there is you see the author's luck of creativity and/or knowledge of the subject.  Also the descriptiosn are very brief with limited illustrations.I really don't understand why anyone will give 5 stars to this book.  I don't care about the money I spent for the book.  I care that I ended up with something that I can not really use to provide my toddler with fun.  For that reason I strongly recommend the othe rbook (Wendy S. Masi's book).  Yes it has 100 instea dof 365 activities, but it is colorfull, easy and pleasant to read and each activity is marked by an ege indicator.

"1730","Entertaining But Apparently Not A Scholar","The book is entertaining, however if you wish to read this from a scholarly point of view and you have spent ANY time studying the ancient world to any degree...you will be appauled to find that the author of this book simply added his own interpretations to events, biblical texts, and blatantly stretched (pun so intended) the truth on so much.  I'd had enough from a research point of view when this guy not onlt spelt the names of gods wrong, but hyped only childish popular perspectives that no closer resemble ancient Sumerian belief than does the golden arches as a phallic symbol.  If you take away any claim of being a historical reference, this book is good.  It's a tongue and cheek look on the penis and that is about all it does.

I will not bother to go through a detailed criticism, not only because it would take an almost book length document to do it, but because, in the highly politicized atmosphere we live in, no one would believe it. Today, the ""truth"" depends much more on one's political views than on an objective evaluation of the evidence.",0

""Advance praise for The Last River"" it reads. In retrospect this means no one is prepared to recommend the book after they have read it.It seems that Todd had a vision of how big a book needs to be, and went to great lengths to flesh out the story to reach his goal. So much of the content has so little relevancy to the story, that you soon tire trawling through it.This was my third Tsango experience. I do recommend the Outside documentary on the Lindgren expedition.

"1336","What Crash?","This book contains some useful historical information and some insights into the mass psychology of booms, bubbles, and busts.Prechter should have left it at that.  Instead, he offers up predictions.  Big mistake.  This guy bases his forecasts on Fibonacci numbers and so-called Elliott ""wave counts.""   He labels all market patterns so that they fit the preordained Elliott Wave 5-up, 3-down pattern.  If you see more or fewer waves than he does in any given market move, you just don't understand that there can only be 5 waves to the top of a bull market.  He's imposing his theory on the market, but surprisingly enough, the market doesn't care.  It does whatever it wants, in however many waves it wants, and Bob has been very frustrated at the market's aberrant behavior lately.  He got lucky early in his career, but it seems he's been fairly consistently getting the market wrong since missing the '87 crash.  Any superstitution can ""seem"" to work if you only look at its happenstance apparent accuracies and disregard its abundant failures.  Keep looking for certain numbers of waves and Fibonacci ratios and you'll find what you're looking for.  Pick any set of numbers or patterns or wave counts, and you'll find those too.  The market doesn't care about any of those things, though.  It's nothing more than an aggregation of billlions of individual choices, which are influenced by an infinite number of factors none of us can ever understand fully.  University studies of various investing methods have found that Elliott Wave, like most, is no better than random stock selection. If Prechter had chosen the random method, he and his followers would at least have a good chance of keeping pace with the market.  Unfortunately, he has been getting everything from the Dow, to oil (he thought it was going to $10), to gold (he didn't think it could break $400), to deflation (the ""deflation"" scare ended shortly after this book came out) WRONG in the past couple of years.  He apparently STILL believes that the Dow will go to 400 (not 4,000 but FOUR HUNDRED) because his charts tell him it should (they've been telling him that since about 1990, actually).  Prechter doesn't understand demographics or economics or markets or the monetary system, all of which render ""Dow 400"" among the goofiest of forecasting absurdities -- unless you believe a giant asteroid will hit and wipe out two thirds of the population (I don't think Prechter is counting on that).Our debt-heavy economy may have a significant crisis soon, perhaps by the end of the decade.  It will most likely be spurred on by inflation and rising interest rates.  But it's not happening now and it's not happening in the way this author has been prematurely forecasting for over a decade.This book came out near the bottom of the 2000-2002 stock bear market, just in time for a reader to short stocks as they began a new bull market.  How typical.  While promoting the book, Prechter said it was ""definite"" that stocks would ""crash""in 2003.  He said that 2003 would be ""the best year yet"" for bears (short sellers).  Late into 2003, when it was clear that the market had proven him wrong, Prechter declared on a radio show that by the end of 2004, the Dow would ""certainly"" fall below 5,000.  Wrong again!

Those two books were edge-of-your-seat reading experiences. This account of a kayaking expedition is just plain boring. The action doesn't start until about halfway or more into the book and even then, the cliched writing and deification of Balf's subjects make this book very hard to get through. Unless you are a serious kayaking fan, I would not recommend this book",0
"1856","A Sad SF Renaissance","Throughout my read, my head kept shaking with disappointment.  If the ""renaissance"" of hard SF relies on stories a full decade, even two decades, old, then the genre's future is feebly fixated on its past.  Not to say that some of the stories here aren't wonderful ... emphasis on ""some.""  But dredging dead decades to claim a rebirth of hard SF fails to deliver on the title's promise.  This is more nostalgia than renewal, and you should read a library-borrowed copy if you want to reminisce about great writers past/passing.  But don't drop any real money expecting a glimpse into Sci-Fi's future",0
"1922","No flavor, no color, no good","I read this book and hated it; I was sorry I wasted my money.... Normally, I would have donated the book ater reading it. But, in this case I was so disappointed, I threw the book away after reading it.  I was disappointed with the author for scrubbing the language so clean that the area she set the book in could have been anywhere in the US.  I was also disapponted in the Oprah book club selection committee.  It seemed to me they found a ""story"" they liked, and that is where their critical thinking ended. It was the only and last Oprah book selection I ever bought.   After reading it, it was obvious to me that whoever had chosen the book for the Oprah club had never been to western Pa.  I am from western PA as is O'Dell and this book lacks local color.  She either forgot or choose to ignore that language is also a part of the landscape of a locale.  Landscape is just not about dysfunctional families, EatnParks and religious statues in the yards.... People in that area of PA say ""ain't,"" ""slippy,"" and ""youns."" This would be esp. true for someone like the main character, Harley. (There are people with college degrees from this area who still have ""color"" in their language.) O'dell is no Faulkner or Caufield. I find this lack of ""local flavor"" with a lot of modern authors.  Unfortunately, our books are even becoming Mcdonaldized. There is nothing special about this book",0

Nonetheless, he offers a limited viewpoint on all aspects of society. Look elsewhere if you want to get a better understanding of where our world is headed and what state we are in.

I think the story would have been more credible if Barr would have thoroughly explored the inner workings of her fictional religious sect and offered more details about it.  Without those details, the book seemed ""unfinished"".  It was like watching a movie and only viewing the actions of the good guy without being exposed to villain.

"1164","Hayek--Orwell's Mentor","   At the height of socialist popularism in England, cir. 1944,  George Orwell, a leading proponent of socialism, believing in its promises as did many,if not most of Eurpose's leading intellectuals and politicians, wrote a review of Hayek's famous book, ""The Road to Serfdom.""  Orwell wrote the review in the ""Observer,"" London April 9,1944.   Hayek, mentions this fact as a footnote in chapter 17 of his classic book, ""The Constitution of Liberty"" published in 1960, as evidence of the disillusionment of socialist intellectuals, when they were confronted with the observation that individualism and socialism were mutually exclusive. Those same intellectuals had not accepted the proposition when advanced by Karl Mannheim in his book, ""Man and Society in an Age of Reconstrucion"" (1940).  Mannheim had been a long opponent of socialism, but Orwell had only been converted after being exposed to ""The Road to Serfdom.""  By 1960, when Orwell had become a world renowned author and staunch opponent of Big Brother doublespeak, Hayek recognized that the political proponents of socialsm which was dying as a political ideal, were now introducing the concept of the welfare state.      While virtually everyone alive today have been effected by Orwell's works and his prescient warnings about Big Brother, how many of us are aware of Hayek's infulence on him?      ""The Constitution of Liberty"" provides its readers with an enormous wealth of knowledge, of which this one footnote is only a small example.  Each reader is bound to be effected in one way or another by the knowledge imparted to them, and this is one of the main lessons to be learned about ""liberty"" which requires the ""rule of Law"" to exist in today's society, but that Rule of Law must be understood.  The failure of today's inteligencia is to fail to fully comprehend the meaning of liberty and its necessity in a world full of confusion from the confrontation of competing civilizations.      Unfortunately, Hayek is no longer alive to help guide us through the new millenium.  Fortunately, he has left us a large volume of work, perhaps more relevant today than it was when written years ago.  While ""The Constitution of Liberty"" is voluminous in itself, it should be kept as a reference book.  Hayek's other works, ""The Road to Serfdom"" and his last published volume, ""Fatal Conceit-the Evils of Socialism"" published in 1980 is a magnificent continuation of Hayek's life long discertation on the evolution of mankind's growth from a tribal, familial society which did not require man to understand or protect Liberty, to a group of city-states that prospered because of the Liberties protected in Athens, but only moderately understood, so that such a great and wise philosopher as Aristotle would believe that freedom could only exist as far as a man could yell.   Hayek's understanding that Western Civilization has prospered from individualism, that it has grown and prospered from the freedom to travel, to trade, to exchnge property, material, real and intellectual.  He explains why man must be humble, that humans progress from trial and error, not from conceited belief that one way or another way is correct.  That to be free and liberated is to be free to make mistakes and government should exist to protect individuals'rights to make mistakes while they attempt to profit in their own ideals and beliefs.

"1556","Difficult Read","I am an avid reader, and I will finish a book no matter how difficult it is, or how boring it is, and I couldn't finish this one. It was so dry - and I couldn't connect with any of the characters. I was really disappointed",0
"1657","Could have Been Great But No Cigar!","I'm sorry to say, this work will not rate very highly on my scale. The author is brilliant, not to mention right on the things he says. It's just that the writer's style is so abstract and nebulous that he's absolutely maddening to try and follow. One moment, he'll be talking about how religion evolved, and the next he jumps to an illustration that takes half a page and uses language that is so illusive you ask, ""What in the world is he saying now?"" I got so excited in the first chapter while things made sense, and then noticed how he drifted here and there, making good points and then totally abandoning them. I bought this book three years ago and just recently finished reading it because I had to keep going out of my way to put it down and come back to it!! It never seemed to get better. I gleaned a few good points and enjoyed it...well...sort of, but the author is so unclear at times that it drives you nuts - and this is coming from an atheist who agrees with the philosophical position of the author!Overall, I really cannot recommend it unless you are a VERY slow, contemplative reader who doesn't mind an unorthodox read. Other than that, the book is packed with some good info. I just wish I could have gotten to it more easily.(JH)www.ministerturnsatheist.or",0

"1019","Farfetched","While reading this book I found the details of some cases to be unbelievable.  Also, the ""photographs"" of the murderers and detectives all looked fuzzy and more like drawings.  I've read a lot of true crime and never heard of catching a murderer because he breathed his asthma medication on the murder victim's hair.  Or because they chemically deduced which cologne he wore. And who leaves their backdoor open when they know a violent Doberman Pinscher has been getting through their backyard fence? Sure, just let that dog on in. And whose place of employment has a record of all employee's blood ""groups"" (not their TYPES, just their GROUPS), when the employee doesn't even know HIMSELF what group he is?Then I read the introduction, which I always skip, and found out this book is FICTION, not true crime as the cover announced and in which section it was in in the book store.As FICTION, it's okay, (I prefer Agatha Christie), but I don't believe the forensic work in this book is even based on any fact. So read it for entertainment, but don't be so gullible as to believe any of it",0
"1904","Way too long and repetitive","I was interested in the plot and characters for about half the book.  After that it seemed that little new information was added, or the little that was new came in the midst of much repetition.

"1852","Unbelievable, and for a very good reason, namely it's not true","This book belongs in the Fantasy section of the library.Let's start with the question of Israel's borders.  Do some folks say that these borders ought to be the Nile and Euphrates rivers?  After all, Israel is kind of small.  Doesn't it need, um, a tiny bit more land?Well, Israel may need a little more land.  But almost nobody is proposing anything like this.  I see very few Israeli politicians demanding even all of the West Bank, let alone all of Jordan.  And as for the Nile to the Euphrates, this is pretty much exclusively anti-Zionist propaganda.  There's a nice article by Daniel Pipes in the March, 1994 issue of Middle East Quarterly that goes into this in some detail, in case anyone cares.Yes, we've seen propaganda before.  In the 1930s, some Germans claimed that the Jews were planning to take over the whole world.  Now, what do we see in this book?What we see in this book is Chris Hedges quoting someone as saying that Israel allows state-funded religious schools to preach that Jewish rule should extend from the Nile to the Euphrates.  Is there any connection between this and truth?Yes, there's a connection.  You see, in the Bible (in Deuteronomy), Moses says at one point that Israel's borders shall run from the river Euphrates to the ""western sea"" (presumably, the Mediterranean, but definitely not the Nile).  Of course, someone might want to ask a Jewish authority about what the Bible says.  It turns out that there's much more detailed material in the Book of Numbers, and that is what Pipes says religious Jews are taught is Biblical.  And that specifies a much smaller Israel.  In addition, it is quite a leap to go from Biblical borders, no matter how large or small, to preaching that Jews ought to rule such an area today.  Hedges is doing us a big disservice here.  You may want to check all this for yourselves.In addition, Hedges has an exciting description of the Battle of Khafji (which took place during Desert Storm).  Some people who were really there dispute it, however.  You may want to check that as well.We also see Hedges describe the behavior of Israeli soldiers in Gaza on June 17, 2001.  Now, remember that these soldiers are trained to obey orders.  Their superiors know that Israel can't afford unnecessary violence.  The soldiers are there to protect lives, not to hurt or kill others.  And in fact, it turns out to be true that in the fighting between Jews and Arabs, the Jews (as expected) have rarely been guilty of gratuitous violence.  On the other hand, the Arabs, who have rather different goals and constraints, have displayed quite a bit of bad behavior.Nevertheless, in spite of logic and facts to the contrary, in this book, Hedges comes up with the following (as usual, I encourage you to verify for yourselves what the truth is, and you might want to start by finding out how many people died that day and who they were):""I had seen children shot in other conflicts that I had covered - death squads gunned them down in El Salvador and Guatemala, mothers with infants were lined up and massacred in Algeria, and Serb snipers put children in their sights and watched them crumple onto the pavement in Sarajevo - but I had never watched soldiers entice children like mice into a trap and murder them for sport.""Well!  What is it about Israelis that could lead them to behave in such a surprising manner?  Hedges speculates that exposure to all sorts of nasty reading material about the Holocaust has perverted these unfortunate young men.  Well, I'm perfectly prepared to believe that men and women from all nations have been exposed to all sorts of reading material.  But I don't buy Hedges' absurd conclusion at all.  Nor do I buy any of what he says about the behavior of the soldiers.  And no, I'm not in denial.  If you believe Hedges, I think you may be in denial, though!I'll stop here.  Anyone capable of saying what I've quoted from Hedges so far is capable of saying anything.  We readers do not need this.",0

"1679","totoally unrealistic for the times","I recently read this as part of a survey of childrens' literature about the Medieval period. Let me say first, that the dialogue is completely modernized, with not even a complex word to redeem it. I know this is because the original is supposedly in dialect, but please, our children are more sophisticated than that. Adam is self-involved, careless, and annoyingly stupid. Despite it's touted 320 pages, this could have been printed in 150, and contained much the same material. The only thing that redeems this novel from being totally forgettable is the snatches of Latin and Old English ballads scattered throughout. If you want your children to have a much clearer understanding of the times, with a book focussed more on character than on plot or modern accessability, have them read Song of the Gargoyle. It's also about a boy who loses his father, and has to search for him, in the company of a dog-like being, but has ten times the depth and realism of this piece of trash. The boy is also a minstrel, of sorts, but he has more likable qualities than Adam, as well as more adventures in less pages. The ending is a happy one, but it involves a twist, which isn't at all forseeable, as theat in Adam of the Road. Please, just skip this, I don't care if it won a Newberry Award, and read Song of the Gargoyle, by Zylpha Keatly Snider",0

"1508","Microserfs 2.0?!?","I'm really a great fan of Douglas Coupland, which is perhaps much of the reason I found this book so disappointing. I hate the fact that it has been dubbed the new Microserfs, since it totally lacks the insight, wit and 'funny because its true' apsects of the original. About the only thing it has in common with  Microserfs is the fact that its set in the same industry. jPod is set in a landscape of unreality, with no apparent reason than to make a series of whacky adventures for eccentric, and for the most part unlikeable, characters. It certainly doesnt reflect the IT industry of today, and the members of the jPod really only seem to represent those aspects of this community which give programmers a bad reputation, as essentially dysfunctional (autistic) as they are. There doesnt even seem to be any real focus for this story. I felt like I was mostly reading about a heap of stuff that 'happened'.Its not all bad, and there were more than a few humorous moments, and interesting plot twists. Coupland's highly approachable and fast moving writing style hasn't changed. Its really just the subject matter and whatever its trying to communicate that seems to have fallen in a heap, in this book. I normally devour all of his books within a day or two, and want to read them again soon after, but it was a real struggle just to get through this one to the end",0

The writing is good, spare and cogent, but the book does not hang together well enough to be a novel, in my opinion.

"1228","Too popular to bother trying anymore.","J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way. In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.As to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.

He comes off as arrogant, showing little empathy towards Debra's problems earlier on in their marriage ( eating disorder, depression, social anxiety).  He writes about very private matters in his book that have nothing to do with the legal trouble Debra was in, but instead are very embarrassing to her.  He comes across as a husband with no compassion.  It's ironic that he goes on and on about Debra's poor choices in boyfriends over the years, and how they were always so controlling of her....and then he goes on to tell us how mad he was because he was a tidy person and Debra didn't keep the house tidy...and he didn't approve of the way she dressed!!  Seems to me that he was no different than the other guys she dated.  He repeatedly reminds us of how smart he is, his GPA, jobs, earning potential, etc...but then admits that when they separated, he sticks Debra with the credit card bill that still had a balance from their wedding and honeymoon to pay off!  He says it was in her name, so she can have it!  Owen shows how little a man he really is in this book. Debra did have horrible things happen to her as a kid, and maybe if she could have married a man with compassion in his heart, she wouldn't have gone down the road she did.

I bought this book after reading the reviews and wish I hadn't paid more than $1 for it. While the title ""The Unprocessed Child"" accurately describes Laurie's upbringing, this book shouldn't be grouped with other unschooling literature. The author, while cherishing the close bond she has with her daughter, reminds me of the mother in ""Love You Forever"" who sneaks across town and climbs into her grown son's room at night to spend time with him--sweet but a bit creepy. The fact that she admits that she even went to college at the same time as her daughter so she could spend more time with Laurie pretty much says it all. The mother clearly has her own issues that I hope she allows herself to work through and heal from now that she's not spending 24/7 with her only child. We have been unschooling each of our four children since birth --challenging temperments and all--and I feel very privileged to spend so much time with them as they discover how exciting it is to decode and discover the world around them. If you want to read a GOOD book about unschooling without unsupported platitudes and preaching in almost every chapter, I would recommend ""Homeschooling our Children, Unschooling Ourselves"".

Also, the author seems to have a 'bad attitude' even though he plays the opening and has several examples in the book.

"1990","Repackaged prepared foods","     I was INCREDIBLY disappointed with this book purchase - especially because I paid FULL PRICE for it. I have absolutely NO USE for it. Why?      Why pay money for a book that simply takes prepackaged cookie and cake mixes, and adds a handful of nuts or dried fruit, (thus, making it ""homemade"") to give away? Anyone with the smallest amount of natural creativity could do this on their own, without the instruction of a cookbook. Let me give you an example: One of the ""recipes"" in this book is for lollipops.You melt down other lollipops or pieces of hard candy and drop a stick in the puddle. WOW. That is CRAFTY. How ridiculous. Even worse, - as you will see by the illustration, - the ""homemade"" 'lollipop' looks disgusting. The stick is about four times as thick as the paper-thin puddle of liquified old hard candy. I wouldn't DARE give such a thing away as a GIFT.     Only a handful of recipes in this book are actually scratch-made from ingredients. The premise of this book is dressing up premade prepackaged foods from your local grocery store, and slapping some notions from the craft store on a glass jar or paper box. While some of the presentation ideas are original and attractive, in general it will prove a grave disappointment to an experienced cook.     I have given this book two stars because it does present lovely photo illustrations of every ""recipe"", and may give you inspiration for packaging and presenting your best recipes as gifts...... but if you have any creative talent and cooking skill whatsoever, - I advise you to seek out another book on this subject. It is not worth the cost of the book.     Should you be interested in the simplicity and economical value (the craft notions to dress the package will cost more than the food you are preparing)found in this book, - PLEASE- buy a USED copy, - it isn't worth more than $3 bucks. This is definitely a publication for a very inexperienced cook - and it is only for such a one I would recommend this book",0
"1811","ruined by its ignorance of female sexuality","I found this book embarrassing to read - not because it's risque, but because it so clearly illustrates how the French & Italians got their reputations as great lovers. Is this the best that English literature can give us? This fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy, let alone female sexuality. It's also mean-spirited. Lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman, and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept. This is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal. He drips way too much contempt.Everything outside of sex is dumb, meaningless, ridiculous. Attempting to derive enjoyment from the ""mental life"" makes one ridiculous; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous; trying to have sex in any way outside Lawrence's own true and correct way makes one pathetic, or defective, or spiteful; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking Lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of ""woman"" or ""man""; and so on. Looking at Italian art is stupid. Everything in Paris is stupid. Constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in France knows how to have sex properly.Reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what's ""wrong"" with everyone except C. and M., one might easily conclude that Constance doesn't really seem happier now that she's sleeping with the gamekeeper, and Hilda does seem happier in Venice - the author counters this by ridiculing ""that kind"" of happiness as delusional and druglike. He even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there's something wrong with her. Of course Constance is wretched, because she does not have that one thing that, in Lawrence's view, really matters in life - not Mellors, but Mellors' equipment. This book does degenerate into phallus-worship, which makes the author's hostility toward ""druglike"" pleasures seem sort of ironically comical.Hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures: from Venice, from the feel of the sun, from jazz, from dancing. This seems weird to me - as if Lawrence is punishing the uppity woman. Hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a ""user"", with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man, only to walk away when the dance is over. (This may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist, since obviously Lawrence doesn't mind if Mellors is callous and behaves as a ""user"".) It's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one's body. Everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex, but his notion of real sex. This is where astute readers will have the most trouble. Lawrence clearly defines a ""real"" woman - Constance Chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples. A woman who lays there ""unfeeling"" is clearly an example. Such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc. Lawrence doesn't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or isn't doing could even be related; it's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically, but in character.On the other hand, a woman with an unfeminine urge to be In Control - that is, one who insists on moving herself, rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when Michaelis is the male (because he's premature, and meant to be pathetic), but it turns unforgiveable when it's women in general and especially Mellor's Bertha, who just refused to come when she should out of spite. Bertha just had a sick (!) urge to be In Control, demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature. The only thing Mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he ""spoilt"" her. As for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy? Forget it. Lawrence suggests that Mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch, but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental, nothing important. A Real Woman doesn't need foreplay. Just hop on and go, and if she's what she ought to be, she'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later.These were what I found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman's duty is to lie there, not too passive, but not too active, and come when she's supposed to (and if she doesn't, it's her own fault); while a man's job is to climb on top and ""perform"". All of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are, unfortunately, not true. The truth is that a woman's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis; there's a thing that both males and females start out with, which in a man becomes the penis, and in the woman becomes (or remains) a clitoris. Lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part. Women have always known about their own bodies; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things, preferably apart from what women think men ""want to hear"". This, too, is no doubt why it has been accused of being ""sexist"". The author (or at least Mellors) openly blames women who cannot or will not ""come to the crisis"" when she ought, as if it were entirely of the woman's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man. It's also likely that science will eventually prove (if it hasn't already) that women like Constance Chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be' emotionally as well as physically. For all that Lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly, even noxious emotions and desires - such as ""intimacy"" and ""connection"", both of which he has Constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act, but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences, based on the notion that a man's biological job is to get his DNA out there, while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment. If this is true, it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant, not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child. So - while there may or may not be women who feel as Constance does, at the same time it's not so clearly obvious that a woman ""should"" feel that way, as to justify Lawrence's open belittling of women whose emotional states don't match masculine emotional detachment and distance.There's a lot of talk of ""tenderness"" - in fact, Constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in Venice of somehow ""lacking tenderness"" - but quite frankly I am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender. The only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her, but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find. I can imagine a woman putting up with - but I cannot imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk, who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal (remembering she's a Lady) when she asks him questions, who calls her c--t as if that were her name, and generally treats her as if she were a whore. I could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of, but this is how their relationship really is; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he won't say and the questions he won't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible.For what it's worth, I think life will be better when this book has become obsolete. It is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages, if not their selves. Those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion. As for those who just want a good read - I'd call it a matter of personal taste. Obviously some people enjoy this book. (Equally obviously, I did not.",0
"1857","Read because it considered a classic","The book is written about an empire in the future.  I'm not really sure why Asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer, which is a dying system of government, instead of a democratic republic.  I know this is nit-picking, but I didn't like this book.  Apparently, the future can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using math and statistics.  Anyone who works as a mathematician or statistician, as I do, knows that it's difficult to predict what's going to happen in anyone's life tomorrow, much less the entire world 500 to 1000 years into the future using statistics.This book is intellectual worship, which is something I can't stand.  Intellectual worship is when people think they are intellecually superior to everyone else, so feel they should rule over everyone else, if only you would listen to them.  This idea drips off the page as event after event is predicted by some really smart dude.  This smart dude predicted a collapse of civilization and treated it as inevitable.  Another idea that's patently absurd- that any event that occurs is inevitable.If this guy was so smart as to predict, with a high degree of accuracy, the downfall of civilization, and the rising of a new one, along with the traumatic events this new civilization would go through, why wasn't he smart enough to avert the downfall of the original civilization.  Surely, with his predictive ability people would listen to him, but he decides to let it crumble for whatever reason.And Asimov is a mediocre writer.  The story is only moderately interesting because no character really gets developed.  I read this book because as a sci-fi fan, I felt obligated",0
"1497","Interesting but lacking....","Timothy Garton Ash's book the file was very provocative and interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the personal experience of one man who happened to be in East Berlin before unification and then was able to see his file  afterwards.  However, i am a bit disillusioned.  The story interests me but  Garton Ash really doesn't say anything!  I am disappointed that he so  poignantly and blatantly pokes at communism and a totalitarian state.  And  yet he does not back it up.  The book is good under the premise of  democracy good, communism bad.  It feels like he is just pooling for  support.  And nobody knew the wall was going to ""fall"" when it  did.  I know of many professors who were writing books critiquing communism  who had to throw out their text because of the abrupt fall of communism.  I'm wondering if this book is just a way to cash in an unexpected event.  I  am dissappointed.  Maybe i just don't know enough of Garton Ash but if this  is the case, i should not have to feel the need to know his history before  reading the book.  The book had some good points and kept me entertained  but on the whole didn't do anything for me.  Peace",0
"1436","Dressed Up Postmodern Metafiction","The first book of Auster's New York trilogy was originally published in 1985, and in 1994 was adapted into this graphic novel. I've never read the original (or any of the other parts of the trilogy), so I can't comment on Karasik and Mazzicchelli's adaptation. However, I can say that since I'm not particularly fond of existentialist or postmodernist literature (those two terms being the most common critical shorthand for Auster's story), this really didn't do anything for me at all. The story is basically an exercise in metafiction, and if you like that stuff, great -- I do not. It is dressed up (at least initially) in the mystery genre, but that's just window dressing. (There's a long legacy, especially in France, of cloaking novels and films of ideas in genre trappings (for example Alain Robbe-Grillet's two books The Erasers and The Voyeur, or the films of Jean-Pierre Melville.)The story begins fairly straightforwardly: a reclusive writer of potboiler mysteries named Daniel Quinn lives in New York on his own since the death of his wife and son. A complete stranger calls him and thinks Quinn is a private detective named Paul Auster and begs him to to take his case. (The writer Paul Auster, and his family, shows up for one scene -- it's that kind of book.) Quinn meets with the strange man, who was raised in rather harrowing circumstances by his professor father, who was seeking to discover the true language of God. The father has been released from jail and Quinn is supposed to keep an eye on him and report. Everything starts to derail when he loses track of both the old man he's been following, and his clients. He spends several months watching the building and going crazy. Once he realizes they've disappeared, he finds his own life has disappeared as well. Obviously this is all somewhat about identity, but it's more about fun stuff like language, representation, and other tiresome postmodern subjects (as are the other two parts of the trilogy, which involve a man spying on someone, and yet another disappearance). It has to be said that the artwork does an admirable job of treating the bizarro world Auster has thrust his characters into. The simple, heavy black and white inking is a perfect match to the material, especially when the representations become less literal and more symbolic. However, if your taste runs more toward things like plots and characters, this is probably not for you. Fans of Auster may enjoy this, but fans of the graphic novel form are probably going to be much less keen.",0
"1992","DIY Cover Up","I too eagerly anticipated reading this book, since I went through an apron-sewing blitz this summer. I was a bit disappointed, however. Although the photos and instructions are helpful (for seamsters more accomplished than myself), the tone of the book is reactionary, with negative statements about working mothers and a lot of nostalgia for the Ozzie and Harriet era. Although Geisel celebrates the rebirth of the domestic arts, she praises the home-as-nest (enclave of traditional domesticity) rather than the house-as-studio (a DIY workshop involving every member in open-ended acts of engagement with economy, history, and culture.) Still, there's some interesting history and some great photos",0

Why this is called a ""field guide"" with its connotation of an exhaustive reference to every kind of manifestation of a particular phenomenon--be it birds, plants, or mushrooms--is yet another part of the mystery of why this book exists.

"1439","Posing for high school seniors","I bought this book to try to learn some useful poses for my subjects, and given most other people's ratings, I decided to give it a try.  However, upon opening the book my first thought was, ""these all look like high school yearbook photos"", which is exacltly what they are.  It seems that that's primarily what type of photography the author does and his book is geared almost exclusively to that market.  His main concern, which he stresses throughout the book, is creating a ""saleable picture"", and he keeps emphasizing the importance of pleasing mom, since she's usually the one with final say over the pictures.  A better title for this book would have been, ""How To Take High School Senior Pictures"".Even then, most of the pictures are not very good, both in their original execution and in their print quality for this book. In addition, the poses are unnatural and awkward looking, and the book is filled with typos and grammatical errors.To be fair, the author does suggest some useful basics of things to do and things not to do when posing a subject, but there is really very little useful information here.So, if you're interested in learning how to take pictures that look like a Sears portrait, this may be the book for you.

"1957","A backlash wolf in sheeps clothing","It would take a book to answer all that is wrong with Farrell's reasoning, but to make a few points:1. He implies that female 'circumcision' is much the same as male circumcision which is astounding but points to his general ignorance. If male circumcision is about teaching males to endure pain (actually more about male tribal bonding) then what on earth is a little girl being taught when she has her external genitalia cut away and is left with a tiny hole and a life-time of pain and health problems?? It's for protection? What, or whose, interests are being protected? 2. He does not acknowledge that the shorter male life-span is due to testosterone and all its consequences for males. Castration is known to increase the male life-span. Why do men even want more testosterone rather than less? Surely illogical?3. The male 'instinct' to protect females is actually to protect the bodies men need for sex and reproduction. As more than 50 million females have been killed recently in Asia simply because they were female should make us question this supposed 'instinct to protect'. And protecting females most often translates into ownership and control. This is a similar logic to that of men in certain cultures that use the pretext of honor to justify the murder of females. Why do women need protection form their protectors? Men need to explain their logic here. Is it something like the protection criminal gangs provide for people against other criminal gangs? 4. Powerless men are created by male-male competition for access to young females and again, the sacred testosterone drives this not women. 5. His views on rape are ridiculous. Young human females have permanent sexual signals whether they want sex or not. These external signals do not usually reflect the females internal desires and concerns and this causes the confusion. Men are responding to fake signals that females don't know how to override without becoming invisible altogether.6. This book is basically about all the hoops males try and jump through in order to rise in the male hierarchy and ultimately get their DNA into numbers of females.The men who fail are the men without power. Farrell wants us to feel sorry for them which is as likely as men feeling sorry for, and diverting their monogamous sexual interest and resources towards, unnattractive old women. 7.Farrell does not explain the irrationality of men rejecting and being abusive about women who don't sexually reject most men (ie the easy women) at the same time as they complain about the pain of being sexually rejected so often by women. There must be some mysterious male logic to it - perhaps situated in a fantasy world of being the only male who isn't rejected. Duplicity is clearly a male trait that farrell failed to mention.8. It is a suspect logic that concludes that the people who have been the lawmakers and political leaders for millennia ie males, have actually only been acting in the self-interest of females. For men to have evolved a lack of self-interest is impossible. To argue that they have is Farrell's most ludicrous argument. Of course women also have self-interest, intimately tied to that of their children. The very real difference is that because we evolved with a mating system where females moved to male-bonded kin groups to breed males had the advantages of size, kin-bonding, no real reproductive demands of offspring and time and cicumstances that enabled them to be the rule-makers which included the enforcement of ownership and control of females as they were exchanged between groups for breeding. They may have felt varying amounts of power within that system and they may have felt the power of their sex needs as female power but to say that this is actually women having and exercising power is absurdly illogical and contrary to reality. It is another fantasy to add to that of South Sea Island free sex and mermaids.This book is interesting for debate and as an example of male sexual frustration being blamed on women. Ultimately it is about how some men suffer trying to get sexual/reproductive access to females and might help us notice that the 'power' being defined is reproduction. In a market where the supply of sperm far outstrips the tiny market of eggs it does reduce the value of sperm and create massive competition in males and competition in females for better quality sperm and/or extras that improve the outcome for offspring. Embedded in Farrell's books is the manipulative attempt to solve this by encouraging young women to 'put out' more. It's the same old male longing for 'free' sex ie the usual reproductive behavior of male animals where post-copulatory costs are carried by females.In nature male animals experience far less or equal disposability as females when they are monogamous and concentrate more on parenting ie are symmetrical with female reproductive behavior. Can we look forward to this in the human male in the near future and solve the whole problem? Can we expect men might consider reducing the supply ie their sex-drive/seeking multiple partners and increasing their childcare. Reduce testosterone? Or is that blasphemy? The new question is What do men want? The answer is the same as ever - sex. The methods of trying to get it are the same even when put in a new wrapper such as Farrell's ie irrationality, deceit and manipulation.Perhaps the real myth is the myth of ADULT power and we should direct our anger and frustration towards our gametes, hormones, fetuses, infants and children that are the real reason males and females exist, are pulled together and driven apart. At least let's not create a new myth that the human male somehow managed to evolve a lack of self-interest. How gullible does Farrell hope we are",0

"1350","A Disciplined Mind Without the ""Disciplines""","Prof. Gardner's book is disappointing. He tries to be all things to all people saying both that he believes in basic competencies but wants to put inquiry first. Also, his language is inflated, and lacking in philosopical specificity. For example, he believes in building up the inner world of ""mental representations"" [unexplained term] yet insists on ""performances of understanding"" [another unexplained term]. Also, he has respect for the individual learner and individual differences, yet he is concerned about the ""position"" or ""situation"" or social class dynamics in which the learning takes place. Thus, he fails to do justice either to the individual or to class, race, or gender.  The role of leadership in learning is wholly ignored; and responsibility is not explored.  In short, it is extremely difficult to pin down Prof. Gardner. It would be kind to say he is eclectic. I hope it's just not fuzzy thinking.However, we can discern that he has a romantic obsession with beauty, truth, and goodness. Imagine -- the Holocaust is reduced to being an illustration of what goodness is or is not! His treatment of these ideas is superficial and banal. I don't like to be so judgmental, but his writing about them does not deserve a detailed analysis.When attacking E.D. Hirsch whom he calls the main speaker for ""cultural literacy,"" he sets up a straw man. He says that Hirsch's school of thought has an underlying belief in the Lockeian ""tabula rasa."" Yet, I find nothing in Hirsch's writings to indicate that he believes in a tabula rasa. Further, is Prof. Gardner really less elitist than Hirsch as some have claimed? I have found that the Harvard elite spend their entire lives trying to achieve and learn everything, and be on top. Their lives are marked by ambition to the Nth degree; yet, he debunks time-honored and experience-honored content areas that traditionally have defined literacy at its best. Thus, I find a certain inherent dishonesty in Gardner's presentation.  Believe me, friends, I have taught students who have many ideals, Greek ideals and other ideals, but know very little, nor do they aspire to learn. If they have those ideals, and if they are facile and glib, will they be the leaders of tomorrow who are embraced by Prof. Gardner?I find a tendency on Prof. Gardner's part to oversimplify certain issues like the Holocaust, and to overcomplicate certain others like the nature of intelligence. The world is not waiting for the concept of intelligence to be re-written.  Am I oversimplifying when I think that there is something very awkward about saying that there is no fundamental difference in intelligence between Einstein and the custodian of my school? Is this awkwardness because I am an elitist putting down the custodian?  Is it because of lack of intelligence that I am still in the grip of a univocal definition of intelligence? I don't think so. Rather, we all know we are dependent on each other, and that everybody has some unique aptitudes or gifts they can express and be respected for, but trying to elevate this understanding to a higher level of truth or intellectual significance seems to me to be illegitimate. Lastly, his writing style is a bit too fond of adjectives, and the book reads as a whole like It Takes A Village by Mrs. Clinton. The Disciplined Mind has a mellifluous style that presents itself as being highly sophisticated and, at the same time, as down-to-earth, with balanced common sense. Yet, ultimately, the book is boring.  As one Amazon reviewer states, Prof. Gardner is full of himself.  In this book, there is no straightforward discussion or emphasis placed on knowledge, justice, Judeo-Christian values, persistence, responsibility, or character development...words which I find essential for a true philosophy of education.",0

I was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure, but was very disappointed in this outing.  The characters were one-dimensional.  After discovering who the ""bad guys"" were I needed to reread part of the book for clarification.  Sue Henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters.  ""...they hadn't a notion just how decidedly things could - and would - change in the next few hours.""  Even the relationship between Alex and Jessie seemed stilted.  I realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher Jessie Arnold, but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little",0

The first half of the book was essentially the author relating fortuitous circumstances that were the product of Serendipity.  He was simply in the right place at the right time, had virutally no idea how he got there, felt out of place the whole time (even when he was raking in the Big Bucks in NY and London), and so now he thought he'd wwrite a book about it.  I also got the sense that he was trying to assuage some guilt from his association at Salomon Brothers.  He was there, he made a lot of money, good for him - get over it!I was also pretty disappointed because the subject matter has A LOT more potential.  I might have actually enjoyed it - had I not read Den of Theives 7 years earlier, and already had some idea of how things took place.  But, if you can get it for $5 or less (including shipping), and you have little to no knowledge of what an investment banker's life is like (and you haven't also seen the movie Wall Street (which covers the same highlights in this book)), then it's probably worth it.I did like the wrap up he did towards the end of the book, relating where he had heard everyone from the firm ended up...althought that seemed a little rushed..",0

"1519","Sociology, more of the same","This is a revolutionary book. It introduces the stage metaphor into sociology; all of social interaction is a performance on a stage. It's questionable how novel this metaphor is, but this is certianly its first explicit statement. The language used to present the ideas of the author is, like most sociological writing, unecessarily complicated. There are some problems with clarity and structure; the book just doesnt have a holistic feel for me. No sociological background is presupposed, there is extensive quoting from other sociological sources, many footnotes, and various other ways to enter sociological literature throught the book. So if you are interested in reading sociology, this is probably a good place to start (again, the language is unecessicarily thick and this may be it's bane as an introduction).However, the book is misguided. The idea of viewing social interaction as a performance on a stage is unecessary. The authors motives for saying this will make my position clearer.(The following is a charicature of the author's argument). There is certianly a large amount of social behavior which is directed towards other people (the audience) in order for the audience to build an impression of the actor. Well, if it can happen here we can draw a parallel with other situations, infact all situations and therfore all of social interaction is like a performance on a stage, ""All the world is not, of course, a stage, but the crucial ways in which it isnt are hard to specify"" (p 72). The performances can either be with individuals, or groups of people, and they can be performing conciously or unconciously. (end of charicature)There are other arguments, obviously, and the statement ""we can draw a parallel with other situations"" is most of the content of the book, which i dont like to gloss over with a sentence. But the real question here is, is the view worthwhile? My answer: No. Social interaction is a complex phenomena that cant possibly be summed up with a signle metaphor. Yes, some social interaction is like a performance, where indivudals are intentionally making impressions on one another. Yes, some social behavior can arise from unconcious beliefs. However, most social interaction is exactly the way we see it, conciously controlled, meaningful, purposeful interaction with individuals; it is not some kind of performance with the purpose of creating a ""reality"".I hope my view of the book is clear so that the biases on the final part of my review can be sorted out: the book is a waste of time. Where the author is right, the statement is little more than common sense. Where the author goes outside of common sense, he's wrong, sometimes plainly so. This book is part of the tradition in sociology of thinking that society pulls the wool over each individuals eyes, that reality is a social construct with no purpose other than social control (here the wool is the performance, and the control has to do with impressions ... but this quickly degenerates into an obscure mess of assertions). There is no real empirical support given for most of the claims. Where ""evidence"" is given, the evididence is so heavily intepreted that it fails to correspond to facts in the world but rather to facts about the views of the reporter. Where there is no correspondence to the world there is no truth. Various sources of sociology are cited, but this is more like intellectual bullying. Saying that some author, which also didnt have any empirical support for his claims, agrees with you is just to bully your reader into acepting your claims. The claims in the book have no practical application in the world, but only serve to intepret situations differently, and in personal opinion, less correctly. Nothing said here will lead to better predictions about social behavior or a better understanding of psychology. In short, this isnt a scientific study at all. My final qualm with the book deserves its own paragraph, the use of language. The best example is the definitions given at the end of the introduction ""A performance may be defined as all of the activity of a given participant on a given occasion which serves to influence in any way any of the other participants"" (15). This is a curios definition. Me breathing while i work is a performance, it changes the percentages of O2 and CO2 in the atmosphere near my co-workers. Me staring into space is a performance, other people see me stare into space and are therefore influenced. Infact, me simply existing is a performance, since my existance causes a gravitational effect on the other participants, as well as influencing them to create beliefs about me existing. Its as if Goffman created a definition for performance which included all possible actions taken by any person, and then wrote a book about how all possible actions taken by any person fall under the category of performance. He didnt. He used a word that we associate with controlled behavior (performance) and defined it in a way no one is used to. Then he used alot of word play to show that behavior has no substance, its all for the purpose of maintaining social reality. I hope this very limited example shows the terrible use of language that is endemic to Goffman and sociology more generally.So an ode to sociology is in order ... actually no it isnt. Why wont this subject go away? This book is an integral part of sociology, and it espouses the methods and style of sociological researchers and writers by being an archetypical work within the tradition. The methods are questionable; the style is obscure. Like it or hate it, sociology is a part of modern thought. Read the book to be an educated person and keep in mind its intellectual failings",0
"1079","Biased genetic studies?","Author La Guardia mentions how the Lemba of Africa have the Jewish gene. Fine! But when he deals (in several pages mind you)with the Falashas (also of Africa) he never mentions that genetic studies have positively shown these Jews NOT to be descended from the 12 Tribes of Israel despite the Falashas's longtime rep for possibly being a Lost Tribe of Israel which, again, has now been 100% disproven through genetic studies",0
"1937","Way too long and repetitive","I was interested in the plot and characters for about half the book.  After that it seemed that little new information was added, or the little that was new came in the midst of much repetition.

"1105","Bones: Buried Deep","I am a huge fan of Kathy Reichs' novels and of the TV Series, Bones. However, this book was quite a disappointment to me.

The author way overused the joke where Brennan did not ""know what that means.""All I could think of was how much better this novel would have been if written by Reichs herself.I started to jot down the holes in the story but quit after a while",0
"1367","Fast and Loose","I suppose every author in this genre comes to the table with an agenda.  That being said, in this book, Mr. DiLorenzo seems to play fast and loose with the facts (or at least with his conclusions).The flyleaf of this book promises ""extensive research and meticulous documentation"" but at least one other reviewer has already pointed out some problems with this author's historical research.  That should raise a red flag to anyone reading this book. Consider this:  The author claims Lincoln was more interested in building an American ""empire"" by centralizing Federal power than ending slavery.  This implies Lincoln was premeditated in what he would do as President.  I challenge anyone who believes that to read Lincoln's actual words and, more importantly, examine his actions.This we know:  Abraham Lincoln was a complicated man and, as a thoughtful person, his views on slavery changed during his many years in public life.  He came to believe that slavery would not die out on its own.I do recommend purchasing and reading this book since it is so different from the mythical view we have of Lincoln today.  However, when it comes to some of the ""facts"" and conclusions expounded in this book be very careful what you believe",0
"1113","Definitely not Alcott's ""Little Women""","I started reading this book expecting to like it - it's historical, related to Little Women, won the Pulitzer, doesn't feel like fluff, etc. However I had a really difficult time getting into the book. For one, the language sounded much more pretentious than historically accurate. I've read other works from the time period she's supposed to be writing in, and rather than feeling in keeping with that era, this book felt indicitive of someone who makes full use of her thesaurus. Also, I haven't read her other book so i didn't enter this novel with a trust for the author. Consequentally, I found that as she mentioned connections to Little Women, I became defensive. She had not proven to me that she had the right to use this work. In some of her character choices, such as one of the first encounters between March and Marmee (I'm not going to go into details so as not to spoil the scene), I believe that she made a radical departure from anything that Alcott would have written of her characters, and that Brooks really did not stay true to the original. The first half of the book is also really dry. This could just be my personal taste, but the first half moved so slowly! The book started to pick up about half way through. Overall, the story being told and the Civil War aspects weren't bad, and could be a decent story in their own right if she'd just speed things along at the beginning.However, I think Brooks did the book a major disservice by linking it to Little Women. I bristled every time she mentioned an individual from the book, because she was really changing their characters (other than Aunt March). The choices that Brooks' characters made were not in keeping with choices they may have made in Alcott's book. In the afterward, Brooks discussed her research and how she actually based the March family and particularly Mr. March more on the Alcott family itself than on the characters from Little Women, even commenting how the March Family in Alcott's book isn't very interesting, and how ""Nobody in real life is such a goody-goody as that Marmee."" If she felt that way, then why use them as the basis for her book? Seen in that context, her earlier *huge* liberties with Marmee's character seem to just be a way to ""stick it"" to Alcott: ""ha ha, look how much more realistic Marmee is now!",0
"1415","Poor parsing of concepts and confusing diagrams","This textbook is more useful for the flashy (and admittedly very good) teacher's ancillaries. But this review is not for the ancillaries. It is for the text itself.The text's treatment of proofs is very cursory and not rigorous enough. The diagrams for the algebraic problems are too confusing, compiling numerous different concepts into one problem. While I agree that students must learn to differentiate one property/theorem/rule/postulate from another, it doesn't make sense that most, instead of some, diagrams are over-complicated. Personally, I don't like the format with the examples, mainly because it downplays the necessity for students to become LITERATE in math, not just a good ""example comparer."" The text has little actual TEXT to speak of.I have not been teaching HS for very long, but I do not like this book. I am not a textbook dependent teacher, but I do (woefully) recognize that students have poor study skills and don't reference notes all the time. I do not teach out of the textbook and I spend many hours planning lessons, lecture notes, my own examples, etc. I had many complaints that the problems were confusing, included too many ideas at the same time, etc. Some may be successful in ""teaching themselves"" from the examples, but I am very disappointed that textbooks no longer have TEXT. I may be a math teacher, but I understand the importance of reading and how it helps a person to process the material. On the other hand, the teacher resources is a great set of worksheets, study masters, note taking guides, etc. Perhaps the authors spent more time on those resources instead of the text.",0
"1896","Not a worthy successor to Holy Blood Holy Grail","This is another offshoot of the commercially successful predecessor.

There are just too many things going on (no problem, I suppose, for multi-taskers!) and way too many characters to keep track of. Also, there's little to no character development even of ""Mr. Chairman"", Juan Cabrillo. The fact that he and his companions are mercenaries (with a penchant for good deeds that pay well) doesn't compare favorably with the NUMA heroes. However, the plots were intriguing and getting the golden budda out of the country was exciting and more like the roller coaster rides I expect from Mr. Cussler and co-writers. I look forward to the subsequent Oregon Files with high hopes. ",0
"1094","Founding Work of Modern Statism","This book, above all others, reveals the breakdown of classical (libertarian) liberalism into the statist liberalism of today.  Although the first part of the work, being a refutation of Edmund Burke's silly  nonsense, is stellar, and is well worth reading.  Regardless, the second  part, the chapter on ""Ways and Means"" in particular, is composed  of the most despicable, anti-liberty doctrines that one can find.  What  Paine basically proposed was a late 18th century form of the welfare state,  replete with progressive taxation, subsidies for child birth, and other  fine statist amenities.  Thus, as all of these things are, in his words, to  be claimed as rights, the title of this book comes to mean nothing  whatsoever.  It is indeed sad that Thomas Paine has gained such an enduring  legacy as a friend to liberty.  In truth, he is actually one of its worst  enemies, as he combines a just zeal for resistance to oppression,  revolution, and reason, he sabotages his entire political philosophy",0

"1127","Wow, what a disappointment!","""The Most Anticipated Book in the History of Poker!"" exclaims a blurb on the cover.  Well, if so, I can tell you that a lot of people have been, or are going to be, VERY disappointed.  Comparing the classic Super/System from 1978 with this book is, to paraphrase Mark Twain, like comparing lightning to the lightning bug.This book is more of a tribute to Doyle Brunson than it is ""A Course in Power Poker.""  Johnny Chan writes a fairly vacuous Preface in which he lauds Brunson, but doesn't say anything about how to play.  Then we have Brunson's Introduction in which he tells us mostly about the contributors to the first Super/System.  Next there is an autobiographical sketch by Brunson entitled, ""My Story.""  (If you want a book that gives the real flavor of Brunson's ""story,"" get a copy of According to Doyle (1984).  It contains 47 chapters in which Brunson recalls his early days and life on the road.)Following ""My Story"" is a short history of Texas Hold'em by Crandell Addington which isn't much, and then there is the first chapter that could actually be considered part of a course in power poker.  This would be 43 tips from Mike Caro cribbed from his lectures and books.  However the tips are hardly ""exclusive"" for SuperSystem2 as claimed.  Beginning with Caro's cute but now very familiar, ""In the beginning, everything was even money,"" most or all of the tips have been recycled.  For example, Tip #18, page 146, ""WHEN A FREQUENT BETTOR CHECKS TO YOU...don't bluff"" is just about the same as Tip #10 ""Seldom bluff if frequent bluffers have checked into you"" found on page 137 in Caro's Fundamental Secrets of Winning Poker (1996).  In fact Caro even recycles his ""exclusive"" tips in this very book.  Tip #31 says that PLAYERS STARING AWAY...are almost always more dangerous than players staring at you,"" while Tip #40 says in part that ""OPPONENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BET OR RAISE IF THEY ARE: ...(3) staring away.""Jennifer Harman's chapter on limit hold'em is so ordinary that it's remedial.  There's not even a hint of anything new.  There are a number of books on the market that cover the same ground much more thoroughly.  I especially recommend Small Stakes Hold'em: Winning Big with Expert Play (2004) by Ed Miller, David Sklansky and Mason Malmuth or anything by Sklansky.  Also her insistence on referring to hands backwards, ""6-7"" (e.g., on p. 252) instead of ""76"" is annoying and contrary to a well-established convention.And the caricatures by Russ Braun!  They are so bland and flattering that each may have passed prior inspection by the subject's mother.  Comparing these to the witty and sharp work by Stan Hunt in the original is like comparing a cliche to something alive and vital.  Brunson doesn't even look like himself.  Here he's just a generic, smiling, dough boy kind of guy--except in the small, clever, lifelike drawing gracing page 7 which WAS drawn by Stan Hunt, copied from the first book.Good are the chapters on Omaha and Stud Eight-or-Better.  However, although Brunson has Bobby Baldwin billed as his author of the Omaha Eight-or-Better chapter, actually it was written (as acknowledged) by Mark Gregorich.  He does a good job of introducing the game and giving some of the strategies, and I'm sure he is a fine player, but what about Bobby Baldwin?  Well, as CEO of Mirage Corporation and President of the Bellagio Hotel and Casino, Bobby is far, far too busy to write the chapter himself.  So he just lent his name and his supervision.  Can you spell R-I-P-O-F-F?Perhaps the most embarrassing part of the book is Doyle's chapter on no limit hold'em.  It is little more than a reprise of the same chapter in the first book published 28 years ago.Also recycled is the section on ""Colorful Names of Various Hold'em Hands"" on pages 628 and 629.  The dated references to Raquel Welch (""38"") and Broderick Crawford (""10-4"") seem more than a little out of touch.  Indeed, this book is nostalgic tribute to Brunson and the great success he and the original book achieved.  And that is a shame, because this book is billed as an exciting event in the history of the publication of books on poker when in fact it is something hastily put together to flatter Brunson and, hopefully, the pocketbook of those involved.One final thing: there is a Glossary, suitable for beginners, which is okay as it defines such things a ""Deuce,"" ""Flush,"" ""Four of a Kind,"" etc., but seems a little basic for ""A Course in Power Poker.""  Worse though is this definition of a ""Cold Deck"": ""A term often used to describe the deck by players who feel they're not getting enough playable or winning hands.""  Players may indeed remark that ""the deck is cold,"" but the origin of the term comes from the fact that a stacked deck used by cheaters that is switched into the game tends to be ""cold"" to the touch since it has not been handled since it was stacked.Bottom line: pass",0
"1036","The Roots of Management Science","This was originally published in 1911 and promulgates the author's task management system.  This was the beginning of the ""scientific management"" line of research and so is widely credited as being the first management science book.  The essay certainly provides an interesting window into an earlier time.  He also illustrates how implementation of management tools requires leadership for success.  Still, a reader shouldn't plan on taking away a great many lessons not available from other sources.  The book should appeal mainly to those specialists working in the field and to historians rather than most readers",0
"1330","A Different Definition of a Classic","Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears.",0

"1891","better red than you","i was more than willing to give None Dare Call It Treason a chance, as i found the scale of Stormer's research impressive. However, the fact that none of his predictions concerning a massive Communist takeover in America came to pass, coupled with his outspoken admiration for McCarthy and truly insane predictions like this:""Once the takeover comes, you, like millions of others, who believe in God and man's responsibility for his own actions, can be slaughtered like diseased animals or worked to death in slave labor camps or brothels for the Red Army."" p. 20have forced me to conclude that Stormer's thesis was overwhelmingly incorrect. Perhaps the most irritating part of the book was his suggestion that the American educative system was hopelessly pro-Communist. The fact that None Dare Call It Treason was distributed in American high school classes rather undermines his argument.the sad thing is, because None Dare Call It Treason is so exhaustively researched, it is far too dry to be amusing, even when read ironically. and ironic amusement is the only positive product of propaganda.in closing, i would take Communism over John A. Stormer's America any day",0

I just couldn't get into the plot. I even found the story somewhat disturbing and eerie, especially for young children to read. There are very evil characters in this book who would be much better suited for an adult sci-fi novel, rather than a book marketed for children and young teens. The characters were unlikeable, and the plot just never seemed to grab my attention. I was very dissapointed that this is from the same author who wrote the amazing Bartimeus trilogy books!

"1118","All Dressed up, No Place to Go","Although Dead Soul begins quite decently and surprisingly for Doss, who has a tin ear for dialogue, dearly loves a cardboard character, and has no sense of plot, it rapidly and unsurprisingly disintegrates into a mangle of missed opportunities. Since most plot reveals take place off scene, you have no idea what's going on until the end where Charlie tells all. Is this supposed to create suspense? Does Doss even realize how ridiculous this is? Does he have an editor? Can the editor read English? Now these are real questions for Charlie to answer",0

The groundwork was there for an interesting serial killer with complex motivation but it never developed that way. The constant head hopping was annoying and the ending came out of nowhere.  Cromwell has obviously gotten bored with her characters and it shows.  This is my last Cromwell",0
"1455","Not great","This book is poorly written.  Although it is one of the most update-to-date versions out ther, it seems muddled and repetitive.  I was surprised at the number of grammatical mistakes and errors.  Clearly little time was spent editing this book.  I'm not sure how it got to be a New York Times Bestseller, outside of the fact that it is related to Harry Potter.  I'd advise going with a different biography",0

"1869","The worst book supposedly about philosophy that I have EVER read","Pirsig mistakes mental illness for deep philosophical thought; he mistakes child abuse for some form of ""real"" child rearing.  I just read his interview in the Guardian UK.   Although it has been years since I have read this book, it still leaves an awful taste in my mouth when I think about it.  I have read philosophy from classic to contemporary; I have lived in Japan and practiced Zen archery and Zen meditation - this book has only incorrect views of Western AND Eastern philosophy yet Pirgsig, to this day thinks he has contributed to the philosophical canon. This is proof that Pirsig remains deranged.  Moreover, in the Guardian UK interview he still found the time to criticize his son who was brutally murdered; Pirsig then tries to elicit sympathy by mentioning his son's murder. Pirsig is a perfect example of someone with Narcisstic Personality Disorder.  Pirsig's son should have sought court protection from his monstrous father and largely absent and/or capitulating mother.  If you are one of the poor souls who finds something ""deep"" in this very large pile of verbal manure then I think therapy would be money well spent",0
"1460","Just Another Book In This Genre","The book claims to help you:1. Say goodbye to aching joints, sagging skin and fatigue2. Improve the quality and function of the genetic material in your cells3. Ramp up your body's self-repair functions4. Increase your stamina, endurance and sex drive5. Dramatically improve your resistance to disease, including cancers6. Have more youthful, radiant skinYou don't need to be a cynic to be able to tell that the claims are all inflated. Sure, you'll see some improvement if you have been leading a very unhealthy lifestyle, but for those of us who are already exercising regularly and eating a relatively healthy diet, some of the tips on progressing further to ""genetic repair"" will sound a bit too good to be true.In fact, most of the advice and recommendations given in the book are not very different from that found in many other books on nutrition and supplement. The authors just gave all the info a ""DNA twist"". I stopped reading the book a few chapters from the end when it begins to talk about hormonal supplementation and some glowing testimonial on the author's services. All ""natural""? No side effects? How long have the subjects been followed up and how long have physicians really practised hormonal therapy on otherwise healthy individuals? The results may be real, but how safe is it for the rest of subject's life?Sounds like another one of those practice-promoting books in this genre. Disappointing",0

"1738","Manifesto of Liberal Pseudoscience","For someone who spends his career attacking politically-motivated science, Stephen Jay Gould does a pretty good job combining scientific research with politics in this book. Gould rambles on and on, attacking giants of modern science like Samuel Morton and Francis Galton, and never putting up any serious scientific conclusions of his own. Gould presents fabricated objections to serious research and selectively excludes studies that make a clear correlation between intelligence and brain and skull size as well as differences in brain size between the human population groups and correlations between brain size and class. Gould only ridicules the most outlandish claims of scientific racism and refuses to pick on findings that have been proven correct. For anyone who has no knowledge of biology, this book will give them a very distorted view of the entire science. Stephen Jay Gould is a paleontologist; evolutionary biology is an amateur field for him, and it would be best if he, as well as all other crypto-Marxists who wish to blend science and politics, stay out of it",0

I'm very tender when it comes to wildlife, and while I know that death is a natural part of the life cycle, I am disturbed by dead wildlife and would never chose a book or datebook containing such pictures.  For anyone who is animal sensitive and dislikes any death photos, then this IS NOT the book for them.  Otherwise, I would recommend it",0
"1381","Highly Literate Sophomorism","This is a well written but ultimately sophomoric disquisition on the concept that if you don't have faith in the supernatural, you have no reason for hope. According to this book, the rational world is such an unpleasant place that, if you are not religious as Schaeffer defines religious, ""[t]he only way of escape lies in a nonrational fantasy world of experience, drugs, absurdity, pornography, an elusive ""final experience,"" madness... .""Piffle! Throughout history, a great many people found life to be good without resorting to either madness or Schaeffer's brand of religion. And indeed, religion and rationality need not be foes, as frequently demonstrated by scientists and science writers, such as Isaac Asimov and Stephen Jay Gould. Reduces our choices to ""religion or madness"" is just silly.Schaeffer in this book champions not religion or spirituality, but authoritarianism with a clerical face. His fans won't like that characterization, but my job as a reviewer is to tell you what's in the book; if you seek comfort in authoritarian religion, this book's skillful wordcraft makes it is a good place to start",0
"1693","Short and Sweet","Judging by the long reviews before me, it should be obvious that there is much to say about Calvin's theology.  This book doesn't say too much.

Not reccomended: readers should look otherwheres for a more balanced and less judgemental review of biotechnology and ethics",0
"1589","Interesting Thesis, but overlooking some important points","Mr. Friedman's book begins with an interesting thesis, defining morality and its definition within a context of economic growth.  The idea that economic growth or stagnation effects the mindsets of the people living in that time period is a logical argument that Friedman often well supports with historical facts.  However, the exceptions to his argument make me wonder if he really believes in his own thesis, or if he just felt the need to write a book.  Furthermore, for every chapter in the book, there seem to be at least one or more flawed arguments or points that, with a little thorough thought or research, don't make sense or can easily be disproven.  With these things being the case, I find Friedman's argument a little hard to buy.  The entire book seems to build up to the final chapter, which Friedman uses to make policy recommendations that would aid in economic growth; this final chapter could have stood alone from the book entirely, however, because the evidence in the book an his arguments elsewhere in the book (ie. the importance of education) do not add or support his final policy recommendations.  His policy recommendations could have easily been listed by students in an economics class as responses to the question ""What should the government do to promote economic growth?""  They don't push the argument forward or indicate anything that hasn't already been suggested in the past, nor do they give suggestions as to how to go about implementing his policies. ",0

Law even sarcastically concludes the chapter by saying this dialogue is only a dream, the real God would probably respond differently.Good idea for a book, ruined by the authors distorted logic. There are numerous ad hominen and circular reasoning errors.The title and premise fooled me into reading it.Mr. Law, how will you pay back the readers for wasting the time they invested in your philosphical rant against religion",0
"1195","Women are from vaginas and men are too","F this self-help industry crap. Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst.

I know this is supposed to be a classic and all that so it's my own fault for not checking when I read the description. I don't even know why I'm keeping it; I'll never read it. You have to wade through tons of technical jargon and lengthy chapters that would be much better served by some large color photographs.

"1956","For those who prefer speculation to reason","The subtitle to this review should have been ""Glaring Inconsistencies & Outright Fantasies"". I've found a large number of inconsistencies with history that should be obvious to anyone who has read this thing closely. For example, on page 7 Coleman says ""the Club of Rome was established in 1968"", but on page 17 he suggests that the Club of Rome played ""a key role in the Cuban Missile Crisis"" and ""attempted to sell its 'crisis management'...progam to President Kennedy.""  Unless we've been misled, the Cuban Missile Crisis happened a full 6 years before this group was founded.  What are careful readers to make of such a passage? Either it's a typo and he means 1958, or, as I heartily suspect, he doesn't have a grasp on his subject.  On page 9 Coleman suggests Henry ""Kissinger's role in destabilizing the United States by three wars, the Middle East, Korea, and Vietnam is well known..."" However, Kissinger, working at Harvard from 1948, had no role in the U.S. government until the 1960's, working for the Kennedy Administration.  The Korean War, as we are all aware, occured in 1950, and ended long before Kissinger had any influence on American foreign policy.  If it were true that Kissinger had an influence on the United States' policy in Korea, for example, then Coleman would be wise to address that issue at this point in his text. However, he only leaves us with the cryptic ""is well known"". It is definitely NOT well known, and Coleman is just fooling those readers who think that a book which is difficult to read or which is discussing difficult subjects must be true.These are just a few of the inconsistencies that I could check in a short time that Coleman throws out at you. If you're not a careful reader, you'll be tricked into accepting some really ridiculous ideas.  If you prefer speculation to reason, then by all means gorge yourself in the sickly sweet nectar of ""what ifs"". If you're looking for something based on reality, then, rider, pass by",0
"1468","old-fashioned elitist boredom","This is a fairly helpful book for those born before the '70s-- a time when ""a yarn"" wasn't an archaic term. Does it give some helpful hints?  Sure, there's the obvious ones like show don't tell and all characters have free will. But fiction has changed a lot since Henry James (thankfully), and this book might be better left unread. Plus, I don't buy the ""only people who aren't well-read don't like it"" argument. I've read nearly all the books mentioned and I still wish I never bought this book",0
"1924","This book should be called Occanumba, not Heartland!","This book is not my favourite in the Heartland series. It is not even really about heartland, the main part of the book is based in Occanumba. Also, there are hardly any horses in this book, just Maverick (who is only a minor part) and a tiny bit of Spindleberry and Albatross. It is mainly about Carey and her mood swings. It is also a bit unrealistic, as Amy comes out eith long, involved, emotional speeches that no teenager i know would blab on about! The way she talks is more like a middle aged psychatrist!I also think that the most recent books have been targeted at a younger audience. At the start of the series i would class them as 'young adult' material, but now they are just for kids who like horses. She is supposed to be going out with Ty but they never seem to kiss much or do anything romantic. In this book he goes to Occanumba with Amy and they don't even get off together once! Even though they are in the forest all alone at one point, with no adults around. All in all this book is ok, but rather boring. Nothing much happens, i thought Amy might at least have an arguement with Joni when she takes over with Spindleberry, but no, Amy has gone middle-aged and doesn't do anything. I would only recommend buying this book if you are a total heartland fan. Carey is really annoying at the start and the horses hardly feature at all. I hope the last 2 books in the series are better, because this one was rather pants. ",0

(another eye roll) ben is being a troll my guess is hes cheating on her, but seriously reading that chapter where they go on this really uncomfortable date just made me want to scream at the book! it was so annoying.the only thing keeping me reading right now is the cammie storyline, i want her to confront her dad and find out what happened to her mom.right now im giving the book 2 stars, after i finish the book (if i ever do) ill come back and edit this. if anyone wants to take me out of my misery and tell me what happened to cammies mom, be my guest! lol***EDIT*** it got a lot better after page 101, the Sam plot got developed (a bit overdone, tacky and stalkerish, i mean a life size cut out? a 100 cell phones? come on, what a waste of money. she could have donated all that $$$ to some charity in peru and impressed her guy a lot more. the cammie story is getting juicier, and parker may have a bona fide crush on sam. i still think ben is a creep. well i guess i wont spoiler everything lol. i'm still not done yet. ill continue this after i finish.***FINAL EDIT*** after a good middle, the book took a nosedive.  the story of cammie's mother was horribly disappointing. i officially HATE ben now and im getting more and more sick of anna for even being into him. what kind of guy tries to make a girl feel weird and uptight for thinking that sex between two people should be special??? that just really turned me off. the girl who wins a contest by wearing nothing but body paint to the party?? okay, this is a book that 12 year olds read, did we seriously need to hear that? the best way to get liked is to get naked?sigh... the two stars rating stands. sorry",0

"1807","E for effort","I am agreeing to the comment of ""E for effort"" on this book.This book describes the author's attemps to improve his condition and how he suceeded. But he admits in his book that he is not sure which ones actually worked. Plus, the author also takes diabetes medications, along with other medicines and supplements. My main concern is what worked for him probably won't work for someone reading this book.This book does not really provide a clear picture on what to do. He made so many changes on the medications and supplements, it is hard to say what worked.One can find the general imformation presented in this book on ""Diet"", ""Exercise"" and ""Stress management"" (relating to clog arteries & heart diseases) through the internet. I didn't gain any new information by reading this book.The printing of this book is also done in a very strange way.

If you are familiar with the basic concepts of customer database analysis, loyalty programs and relationship marketing, there is nothing new here.  In fact a much better introduction to all those concepts is The Loyalty Effect by Reichenheld or Customer Connections by Wayland and Cole.  The subtitle mentions the dot com world, but the book has little to say about the Internet.  The book really does not cover CRMs (as oppsed to database marketing) in that it fails describe how CRM systems work and what database, modeling and communications platforms are required to implement them",0
"1744","The Gothic aspects did not work for me.","This is the second Nevada Barr that I have read. I picked it up on the strength of Deep South, which I thought was really terrific. It was frustrating that nearly all of what I liked about Deep South was missing from Flashback.Flashback is structured with interwoven narratives which involve both the real-life murder and a civil war mystery related to Anna Pigeon's own family. The civil war story (told through letters and dream-like sequences) is clearly intended to add a note of gothic mystery to the story. Some may like the flavor that this element provides, but for me it dilutes the elements of the writing that I most enjoy. I really liked the crisp realism of Deep South, and felt that the style put it a cut above most books in the genre. Flashback, on the other hand, felt painfully contrived. The plot line with the letters was extremely unrealistic and (to my mind) unnecessary. If you like historical mysteries with a gothic flavor more than you like realism in a detective novel, then you will probably be significantly less bothered than I was by Flashback. Barr at least made a clear choice with her approach to the book. Judging from the reviews, not everyone had a negative reaction to the interwoven plot lines.I will go ahead and pick up a third Barr book, because I did like Deep South so much. It was disappointing to have not had my high hopes realized with my second outing, but hope that it can be redeemed with a third.",0

"1406","Reinharts disappointing hyped coffeetable bread book.","As a professional, certified chef and baker, I am also an avid baking and cookbook collector. After seeing that this book won and the James Beard and the 'IACP Cookbook of the Year' awards -both prominently displayed on the cover of this book- and after reading the 'too good to be true'-reviews on Amazon -some reviewers sound so exalted and in trance as if Peter Reinhart is the Jesus Christ of Bread- I finally decided to buy this expensive book. What a dissappointment! For all those blindly following Reinhart as he were the Saviour of True Bread, wake up! Reinhart's book is simply flawed. Compared to other bread books, it's even a quite average book. But one that is luxuriously packaged. A lot of hot colorful expensive air. And it's expensive not because of the info and exlusive bread knowledge in it, but because of the super luxuriously editing. This is a book for book enthousiasts, not for bakers, professional or home. I see baking and cookbooks mainly as working tools, as information and inspiration. Not as eye candy. If you want nice pictures, buy an art book. A book on baking bread with these awards behind it, should give you tons of new info about ingredients and techniques, original insights, an appetite for baking, factual info, the newest and tested developments in technique... What you get here is a fluffed up egotrip. 47 formulas and ample bread info packaged into a shining 30-40$ publishing hype.Don't get me wrong: this is a beautiful, expensive book. But one you don't use in the kitchen, and certainly don't smudge with butter but put on the coffee table in the living room to impress guests and have polite conversations about. But as a source of new information or enlightening up to date bread knowledge, giving pointers about using new bread ingredients combined with old proven bread baking techniques, as a working tool sweating near the hot oven at home or at a bakery, compared to other bread books, this book fails miserably info-wise. But it has a snappy lay out. Jeff Hamelmans 'Bread, a Book of Techniques' and Rose Beranbaums 'Bread Bible' give the readers much more practical info and insight into bread baking. They talk more about the subject 'bread'. And not about themselves like Peter Reinhart clearly relishes. Mr Reinhart clearly sees himself as so important and interesting a person that we read in this book about his wife and their sightseeing in Paris. How about the bread info, the kneading, rising, baking, ingredient- and techniques info? I honestly prefer industrious bakers who pass on their baking knowledge clearly without having to read at which hotel room they stayedin. Bakers with such big ego's that think that readers of a Bread Baking book are more interested in the shopping experiences of the wife during 'a learning trip' to professional bakers on which she accompanied him, than in another bread formula's, should work in shobizz, not in a bakery or a culinary school. Big ego's with more talk than substance galore in the food industry. Reinart is, judging by this book, sadly also one of them. I don't see in a 1000 years Rose Beranbaum in one of her books rambling on about her husbands prefered color of ties or Jeff Hamelman writing in a bread book about the time he spent with his wife in Paris. Mr.Reinhart: your readers forked out 30-40$ for bread info, not your personal travel experiences. As you as a teachers no doubts sometimes say to a pupil: Stay with the subject! And the subject of this book, for which I paid is 'Bread and Baking. If we want to know about your personal life, we'll read an interview in People, if they find you interesting enough.Peter Reinharts 'The Bread Baker's Apprentice' as a 'Bread Book' is simply a marketing creation. Smartly edited, but way too short on substance. There is not much new information on bread. Worse: there is not much info at all! In total for 30-40 $, you get exactly 47 formulas on 307 pages of which 2 color photo pages are simply ads for other books by Ten Speed Press, the editor or this book. Compared to Beranbaums 640 pages, Hamelmans 400 plus pages, that is a big difference for a big price. With Reinharts book, you get a lot of shining white surface that in other Bread books is filled with bread info. As a buyer of this book, you also pay for full page black-and-white and color pictures that are pure filler. See p. 3, 6, 26... And why is the beautiful model Fumie on the cover of a bread book and not mr. Reinhart himself or even ... bread alone? With Reinharts next book they will no doubt put Kate Moss in an apron and a bakers vest. Package the air attractive enough and the readers will swallow it and fork out the 30-40$. Never mind the content. Let's talk a bit about the formula's. That should be an important part of a baking book, right? And they should be original and fine tuned, right? Sadly to say: nothing new or original here. Some aren't even fine tuned. And baking is all about fine tuning. Worse, almost all the formula's can be found in other bread books. And, most insulting for a buyer of this book, a lot of the mere 47 formulas (Reinhart uses this expensive word because 'recipe' propably doesn't fit into the marketing of this baking book) in this book are rehashed or directly derived from Reinharts former book 'Crust and Crumb'. Clever marketing and ba-da-bing! By the way, 'Crust and Crumb' has been reedited in 2006. At a fair price, I admit. So if you want your dose of Reinhart at a right price without the pomp, scï¿½nes of a marriage, without Peter Reinharts comment on the Eiffel tower so to speak... buy 'Crust and Crumb' and leave this luxuriously edited egotrip on the shelves. But before I buy I would also first flip through Beranbaums and Hamelmans bread books in the bookshop or in the Amazon shop. As for this book, you should ask yourself: 'Do I want a serious bread book or a nice coffeetable book?'. Taking in consideration all the egostroking in this book and in reviews, as a baking book for the world market, this book is almost worthless. The universal accepted working standard in worldwide baking is metric weight. Like it or not, but that's a fact. You weigh your ingredients carefully by grams, kilo's etc. Reinhart visited French top bakers Poilane and Gosselin, clearly admires them and aspires to reach their level of baking. I don't think that Poilane measures in cups and ounces! But even then, let Reinhart measure in cups for the home market. But then have the decency to add the metric equivalent in the formula's itself for the rest of the world. This guy goes on and on about his wish to bake authentic European inspired bread like ciabatta, fougasse... About a Worldwide Bread Revolution! And then he refuses to use the most important tool to make these breads: the same language, the metric weight system. Rose Beranbaum places the metric equivalent next to the cups/ounces. It's a simple as that. Bread is a world food, so use the world standard for baking. If not, market your book mainly to the USA market and be honest and upfront about that. And don't give us that inflated hot air babble about a Worldwide Bread Revolution without using the worldwide accepted working standard, the metric wieght system! This big flaw makes the book almost useless for bakers outside the USA. The Worldwide Bread Revolution won't be for tommorrow if we have to use this book worldwide!Next point: Reinhart advocates instant yeast over fresh pressed yeast. Every baker worth his salt (or yeast) will tell you that fresh yeast gives a far better taste, volume and texture. Yeast is a living organism. As 'instant yeast' it has been dried and put on the shelves for God knows how long. It's like you force a just woken up coma-patient, that has been dormant for months, years... to run a marathon. Fresh, pressed yeast is still alive and its taste and texture are a world of difference compared to 'instant' (aka dried) yeast. Try the difference between fresh yeast and instant yeast for taste and texture and fully developed rising at home, and judge for yourself. To place fresh yeast on the same level as instant yeast is preposterous for someone like Reinhart who spends days on his pre ferments! For scientific back up, you can always read the recently translated book of world renowed food scientist Herve This 'Molecular Gastronomy, Exploring the Science of Flavor' (Columbia University Press 2006).And it gets worse. Reinhart frequently uses shortening instead of butter or olive oil in his breads. If Poilane hears this, he'll drop dead! Every baker knows that even a small amount of butter gives a much better taste and texture than shortening. Shortening produces a rancid/metallic taste and a slimy, unpleasant mouthfeel. Not to talk about health. Most shortening is choc full of trans fats which are much more unhealty than butter fat. Read Harvard's nutrition professor Walter Willets book: 'Eat, Drink and be Healthy' (Free Press 2001). New York has already picked this info up. Professional food writer and teacher Reinhart hasn't or doesn't care. For instance, Reinhart proudly declares -not as a joke- that in Italian bread you can use shortening instead of olive oil. In Italian Bread! Come on, let's be serious. And this guy teaches at the Culinary Institute of America! It's like he is advocating spam to put on the BBQ instead of beef! If that is the standard of baking that Reinhart uses, he'll have to wait a long time to reach the standards of a Poilane. Then there is Reinharts Hygiï¿½ne Problem. There is an international standard for basic hygiene in food called the Hazzard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP). Reinhart as a professional tutor and teacher must no doubt know the HACCP by heart. The first thing in hygiene that an apprentice baker learns, is that before even touching ingredients, he must remove all the rings on his fingers. Because the place underneath a wedding band for instance, is the place where the filth gathers and bacteria feast. And kneading dough with all that filth underneath a wedding band that you keep on, is not only very dangerous for the health of customers, it is simply not done for a baker. I like my bread without filth baked in, thank you very much! In the school where I earned my diplome in baking, if a student had a ring on during practical class, he had to leave the class immediately and he lost important points for his exam. Yet we see professional teacher and Bread Book Author Reinhart kneading dough WITH HIS WEDDING BAND ON! See p. 36-37, 82-83, 255, 245... Unforgivable in a 'professional' baking book. And all the more in an expensive book that won the James Beard and IACP awards! Has anyone of the juries of the James Beard Foundation and the IACP, any basic knowledge of food hygiene? Has nobody seen this cardinal sin against food hygiï¿½ne in a so called 'professional Bread Book'? One other thing, for a bread book that pretends to be world class, there is no word about gluten-free bread. Not one formula. And this while more and more people are allergic to gluten (protein in wheat flour).To end on a positive note, one thing I found acceptable in this expensive coffee table book, was his 55 pages with the 12 stages of bread. But, fellow reviewers, you can find all this info and more, and explained more clearly, more detailed and to the point, in Hamelmans 'Bread' and Beranbaums 'Bread Bible'. And it doesn't take 55 pages of expensive high quality shining white paper. Peter, take out all the white empty space, learn to write more clearly and to the point, and you can say the same thing in 20 pages. Which leaves you 35 pages for more formula's for example. But if you haven't any formula's left or are preparing a new book, then, yes, by all means stretch the 12 stages of bread to 55 scarcely printed pages instead of 20. Why make it simple if you can make it seem difficult, impress your not so knowledgable readers and in doing so stroking your own ego?So despite all the hoopla, hyped reviews, near hysterical praise and important awards, this is simply a too expensive, show off-book. It's like the tale of 'the King with no Clothes on'. Somebody has to yell: 'Hey, wait a minute!'If you want good books on bread baking: buy one by Jeff Hamelman, Rose Beranbaum and Bernard Clayton. You don't get a model on the cover, but the content is all the better. And in a bread book, isn't content more important than packaging",0

"1456","does too much and too little","by focusing primarily on the history of the swimsuit Pollard's book does not address the larger issue of modesty in public dress as effectively as he might. And while the history of fashion sheds light on fashion, (i.e. swimsuits have observably become skimpier over a century) Pollard can offer no explanation except the caving in of Christian virtue. This is basically saying Christians have lost a culture war without explaining why. While the initial exposition on what the parameters of Christian modesty mean Pollard provides no application for what a suitable example of Christian modesty would be. Furthermore, when push comes to shove he refers to the Westminster Larger Catechism for application rather than sticking to the biblical principles he espoused. Some of his cases are self-defeating. On one hand he notes that garments in biblical periods could be sleeveless and then states that the inexorable decline of swimwear in the west into sluttiness really began when sleeveless swimwear appeared in the mid-19th century.  Props for giving the topic serious consideration but as an exegetical study it is still wanting.On the other hand, it's cheap so if you're not persuaded the research has been effective it won't cost you much",0

But from this point onwards the story becomes painfully predictable as time after time Case takes the predictable rout. Finally the story completely falls apart and it was like when you watch one of those really bad action flicks where the hero saves the day time after time and its so stupid that you get a bad headache. I have read one other Case book I think, his ""Kingdome Come"" that was written under a psudo name, or maybe Case is the psudo name, I'm not sure.

A series of ""Rogues"" from previous books is paraded before the reader without really adding to the story.  And the conversations are so boring that I simply had to skip them.  I guess this may be enjoyable to new romance readers who do not know better or hard core Beverly fans",0
"1100","White Males Only","Before purchasing Made in Detroit I read the reader reviews.  The reviews were so mixed that I decided against buying the book and checked it out of the library instead.  As it turns out I made the best decision.  All I can say is `thank you fellow reviewers'; this book was definitely not worth the purchase price.  My statement has nothing to do with the author's writing skills, he is a skilled writer.  It has everything to do with his lack of insight.  That Paul Clemens could live in a city and have such a skewed view of it is downright scary.  I read the book, waiting for Paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them.  But after 241 pages he was no more enlightened than he was on page one.  Blacks are caricatures whose sole role in life is to make Paul's life hard.  Women are peripheral characters who are barely given a voice.  He finds a way to put down and demean everyone who is not a white male in his book.  If you are a white male who harbors secret racist feelings you will enjoy this book and it will validate your feelings.  If you are anyone else your reaction will no doubt range from mild boredom to outrage.  As I read this book I felt sadness, a profound sense of dismay and had some of my worse fears confirmed.  (There are white folks who actually still think like this.)  My hope is that the light comes on for Paul, he is still young.  If it does maybe he will share his insights with us.  ",0

"1732","The Bad Borin Book of Evil Tricks","Have you ever read a book that just seemed to drag on and on?  For me, that was this book.  If you like fantasy then you might like this, because that is the genre of this book.  It is about a Jewish girl named Hannah.  She goes to a family party and hears a knock on the door.  She opens it and then sort of wakes up and she thought it was a dream.  She now has a new name, Chaya.  She now has to figure out what happened, and what she will do in this body.  It takes place in New Rochelle.  It is old times.  It doesn't give a specific time but you can infer by the clues and setting.  She doesn't know why this happened to her but she must try to fix it.	I didn't like this book at all.  I thought it was really hard to follow.  You have to pay attention throughout the whole book.  You can never daydream or you won't know why they are calling her a new name.  This was definitely made for older adults, or people with a higher reading level.  If you are a good reader and you like to challenge yourself, try this book.  I don't recommend this book if you are younger, or just not that well of a reader.  This is for very and I mean very good and high level readers.  I would say between the ages of 25-60 might like this book.  I don't think this book was a page turner.  I wanted to put it down, instead of not wanting to put it down.  It never sparked my interest.  Her being Jewish, and the book being a fantasy, I couldn't relate to anything that happened.  This book was hard to concentrate on.  If you look up for one second, you miss most of the story, so concentrate hard.  I couldn't relate to anyone. I am not Jewish.  If you are Jewish, you might actually understand this book better than I could.  I didn't like the genre.  It was all fake and totally unrealistic.  If you like that sort of stuff, then read this book, but I don't like fantasy.  I didn't like how it was written.  It was too hard to concentrate on.  I had to reread twice to find out why they are calling her a different name.  I never found any surprised in the story.  I could guess what would happen next.  It was predictable.  None of the chapters had cliffhangers.  If just was boring and that's it.  I thought it was extremely boring.  I didn't understand anything and I would rather do my homework, than read that book.  My mind wandered a lot.  I had to read sections over and over again.  I never believed the plot one bit.  With the story being fantasy, everything is farfetched.

"1333","Interesting, but....","While this is a well researched and thought-provoking piece of literature, I do have some critical comments to make.Firstly, it is apparent that the author's own holocaust experiences (or more specifically, those of his family) have left him with a vested interest in how the material in this book is presented.Secondly, there is a LOT of content to trawl through to get, in my opinion, a few pieces of interesting material.Finally, the underlying theme or accusation that without IBM the holocaust may not have happened, or would not have been so sever, is (again in my opinion) flawed. As the book shows, IBM certainly made it much easier for the Nazis to locate and identify Jews, it would not have been impossible without IBM.Having said all this - it was an interesting read and although overly wordy is certainly worth reading",0
"1499","The Rest of the Story","This is a very famous and a very influential book. This was not the first time I checked the book out of the library but I now know much more about antidepressants and the related issues than I did when I first became familiar with Kramer's book. What I found on my quick survey of the book this time amazed me. This is not a book supported by research. It is a book of stories. The stories, one after the other, are about Kramer's patients (Kramer is a psychiatrist) and how taking Prozac dramatically transformed lives overnight. Consider these four examples.1. Sam: ""Sam not only recovered from his depression, he declared himself better than well. He felt unencumbered, more vitally alive, less pessimistic. Now he could complete projects in one draft, whereas before he sketched and sketched again. His memory was more reliable, his concentration keener. His memory was more reliable, his concentration keener. Every aspect of his work went more smoothly. He appeared more poised, more thoughtful, less distracted. He was able to speak at professional gatherings without notes.(Page x.)2. Sally: After four months on Prozac, she looked brighter, calmer, self-assured, in control of herself. The most important effect of the medication, Sally felt was that it cleared her head...After ten months...she negotiated a small promotion and pay raise at a time when the bank was cutting back staff...More remarkable was the change to her private life. She started going to dances...(Page 147.)3. William M: The patient's low self-esteem, which had been present since his earliest childhood, began to disappear...On medication William M. experienced a sense of self-worth superior to any he had felt before. (Page 203.)4. Ms. B: For the first time in her memory she felt perfectly relaxed and happy sitting at home reading books or listening to music and felt less of the free-floating anxiety that was previously quelled by going out...Off Prozac, Ms. B. bar-hopped in search of men. Prozac moderated her sense of aloneness and allowed her to enjoy a variety of social settings.Dozens of other examples could be cited. The point is, this is essentially the book. It is a book which convinces the reader of the almost magic power of Prozac by sharing stories like these. What is disturbing is that I now know the truth. Research investigations have found that the power of antidepressants has increased dramatically. They are now more effective because our belief in the power of a pill to cure social shyness, anxiety, depression, and a bad temper has increased dramatically. We have come to believe, as Kramer puts it, ""biology is destiny"" (page xiv). No where does Kramer explain that the longest of the clinical trial used to get approval of Prozac to market was only 8 weeks long. No where does he share that a tranquilizer was given to study subjects and the other tricks used to make the effectiveness of the drug appear greater than it really is. The dangers of long-term use (diabetes, Parkinson's disease, permanent muscle jerking, etc.) are never discussed. (Of course, these problems were still unknown when Kramer wrote.) See Timothy Scott's wonderful, and unlike Kramer's book, carefully documented book America Fooled: The Truth About Antidepressants, Antipsychotics, and How We've Been Fooled to find the dangers as well as what does bring good mental health. Yes, this book has been influential. Thus, Kramer bears some of the responsibilty for the myth surrounding antidepressants. (They do not work as well as exercise even--numerous studies.) It's funny how, as our knowledge grows, a great book beomes a harmful book, but it is just that.   ",0

Neuman, of Mad Magazine, with his declaration of ""What, me? Worry?"" provides a pithier statement of the philosophy proposed by Ms. LaRoche.

"1549","A quick read and a quicker write","The number of books written in our society is huge and getting huger. Everyone recognizes that far more books are being written and published than can be read. Why are people so anxious to be authors in such a market? One reason, apparently embraced by the Goldstones, is that it is so EASY to write a book! All you have to do is write down some reminiscences of your experiences. They don't have to be particularly interesting experiences. You don't have to do any research into your subject. If you describe what all the people you encounter are wearing, if you go into details of how you found a babysitter for each trip you took, if you quote verbatim phone calls from relatives and shop keepers (even if they are not interesting or witty), and if you describe the hotel rooms you stayed in, you can finish the book in a couple of weekends! And readers can finish the book in a couple of hours with little harm done.The book does accurately represent the travails of beginning book collectors, and I recognized some of my own experiences in the stories the authors tell. However, the book does not take the effort to educate readers so that they can skip over common early errors, nor does it attempt to answer many of the questions that the authors themselves raised when they first began collecting. What determines the price of old books? Why are first editions important? Why should Tarzan books cost more than great works of literature? These are good questions that anyone might think of when getting into book collecting, and you will find the questions but not the answers here.The book is written in a breezy style that is easy to get through, and if you have two hours at an airport to kill, you could do worse than to read it. But by the time you arrive at your destination, you will have likely forgotten most of what you just read, because so much of it is ephemeral details of the authors' own lives, transportation problems, and experiences. If you are really interested in book collecting, it would be wise to read one of the many books that describe what one should look for, how prices are determined, different styles of book collecting, and so on. Fragments of this knowledge are transmitted in this book, but they will leave you with more questions than answers.To be sure, not every book about book collecting needs to be a font of wisdom. But the entertainment value of the authors' experiences was weak, and did not make up for the absence of useful content",0
"1726","too much homoerotica","I appreciate that there has to be some of this to cater to the various tastes out there--but this book has way too much.  I read 4 stories in a row that were either about lesbians or bisexual men. I am going to stick to books that have more balance or emphasize hot sex between men and women.  The other stuff just doesn't do it for me.  I got bored and started turning the pages fast.  Disappointing",0
"1257","P L E A S E . . . buy something else","Many reviewers on this site read TLGPE in the 70's, when we were young and impressionable. (I happened to be 13 when I read it.) If one could be sued for intellectual forgery, Lindsey would certainly be found at fault.Most of us, thankfully, have gotten past our fears that plagued our teenage years. After all, when we read TLGPE, we were young. We were searching and seeking. We didn't have all of the facts. There were wolves who knew this, and they preyed upon us. Many people who were older, yet still intellectually undeveloped, read this book and were moved to 'believing'.For most of us, our minds matured. We began to see the vast chinks in Lindsey's pompous Christian armor. We began to realize that fear is a weapon brandished by madmen, by people who use a subtle, gentle cloth of manipulation to control others.This is beyond dangerous. It is beyond extreme, as most of us have now found out.I love a good horror novel. I love a good 'true crime' thriller. But the fact that people read Lindsey's books and take them at face value is, perhaps, one of the scariest notions I have ever imagined.That, dear reader, is beyond horrific . . . and far more terrifying than anything you'll find in the bible or any of Lindeys 'books'. The only thing scarier is that Mr. Lindsey is still receiving royalties from an outdated, silly, contradictory and completely barbaric book penned over thirty years ago. Please don't be the next sucker. Please don't add this one to your cart.",0
"1451","Generalized overview with little new insight","I agree completely with the Becksted review (I also noted that it was helpful, but I meant it would have been helpful had I read it before I bought the CD).This refers to the CD version.  I did listen all the way to the end, I kept thinking there was going to be something, but continued to be disappointed.    I found the analogizes to be strained beyond usefulness (evaluating someone's integrity by the size and shape of the wake they create... are their people waterskiing on it?) It seems to be politically incorrect to come out in opposition to ""integrity"" in this day and age, but frankly this book didn't help me much. ",0
"1802","Betty's Not What She Used to Be","Time was when the words Betty Crocker actually stood for something good in cookbooks, although the books' recipes, for better or for worse, were always a product of their times.  The very first ""Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book"" was published in 1950 (still available), revolutionized how cookbooks were produced, and was an enormous best-seller.  The recipes were the result of much thorough testing in the company's kitchens and in homes across America.  This was cooking from scratch with very little reliance on convenience foods in its pages.  This gradually changed as Betty and her books became more and more of a shill for General Mills' products and her name got plastered on one mix after another to the benefit of the company's bottom line, but to the detriment of good cooking.  The two all-purpose cookbooks that came out in 1961 and 1969 were both loaded with recipes and wonderful tips/helps, although you could see the beginnings of sacrificing quality for convenience--especially in the 1969 edition--but this was still relatively minor in proportion to the majority of the recipes.  If you have one of these books, treasure and keep it; you'll never see their likes again.The current 10th edition looks good but, like the past several editions, the number of recipes has been drastically reduced.  Gone are the many variations, which are especially missed in baked goods.  It was wonderful having recipes of many cakes that were sized for two people or small families and having different mixing methods to choose from.  Now way too many recipes are of the ""dump and stir"" method instead of choosing methods that would insure the best results.  Also gone is the very friendly, assuring, conversationial voice of yesteryear.  Yes, there are recipes covering a wider range of ingredients and styles, but they are mostly stripped-down versions.  It's obvious that the folks at Betty Crocker now seem to think that no one really cooks anymore and can't be bothered with proper preparation of dishes, which begs the question of why General Mills even bothers to publish these cookbooks anymore.  The ""Better Homes and Gardens New Cookbook"" is a better bet for those looking for an all-purpose, everyday guide.  It has a better layout, the recipes and ingredients are generally of a higher quality, and there are more recipes and variations than Betty Crocker's had in some time.  Even better, if you care at all about the quality of the food you eat and serve your family, I highly recommend the cookbooks of Cooks' Illustrated/America's Test Kitchen.  Their comparable, general-purpose cookbook is called ""The America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook.""  The recipes are tested and reworked--dozens of times, if necessary--to be the best their staff can make them and you get precise directions in preparing them.  It's a shame that Betty Crocker has abdicated her throne and good name, but there's even better stuff out there now.  Go for it!",0
"1953","What a dirty trick","I was seduced by the sinister cover and the synopsis on the inside cover into thinking this was going to be a chilling account- Account my foot!

"1798","Knew it was bad after three pages","I'm sorry, but I expect more out of a book. Beginning on page one the character development was infantile and the writing sophomoric. After reading beautiful books such as Cold Mountain and Brideshead Revisited, to mention just two, I found that this book started off so poorly and was so amateurish that I knew it would be a plot-driven monstrosity that wouldn't be worth the read. At page four I was fed up with the author's style and slammed the book shut",0
"1597","This is disturbing..","That so many people gave this book five stars really concerns me. Luckily, I bought this book used, otherwise I might be kicking myself for paying full price. Between her utterly uninspired ""devotional dances"" to things such as sex, wisdom, and the ""Sticky One"" (a term she made up for the astral body), and her constant blabber about masturbation and rubbing your juices all over everything to ""anoint"" it, I was unimpressed, to say the least. However, driving on a trip a friend and I got a lot of laughs out of flipping through this book. It's very, very amusing if you don't take it seriously. The thing that makes me sad is that she's just using her sexuality to sell a feel good waste of paper with absolutely no depth. There's nothing evolutionary about it, unless you consider being a wanton, idiotic freak ""evolutionary"". If this is what humanity is evolving into, I am frightend",0
"1867","You must be kidding.","I wish I could have back the numerous tedious hours slogging through White Noise to the bitter, bitter end.  Not since Jane Smiley's Moo has such a dull tome been written aobut, among other things, Ameican academia.  Little happens of note.  No one cares about the cardboard characters.  Someone gets shot in the belly, for no good reason.  And yet this is fawnedover as a comic masterpiece by, among others, The New York Times.  I ahve been told to read White Noise before I picked up Underworld.  Have no fear.  I'll undergo root canal without Novocain before I try that one on for size.  I've been reading nothing but plumber's trade journals and German magazines just to try to get the taste of this novel out of my mouth for the past few days.  I'm thinking of getting the definitive Curious George collection just so I don't have to read any words.  At least that guy in the big yellow hat knew enough to keep his mouth shut, unlike that noncompoop Jack Gladney and his boring friends.  If people prersist in thinking this is great literature, I suggest giving up reading altogether. ",0
"1993","I make movies and travel extensively. My life is great. ","This is not very good. That is to say, the writing and the fluidity of Gazzara's life become bland and uninteresting quite fast. I initially picked it up because as an actor I find biographies or autobio's about somewhat lesser known people more curious than approaching someone like Paul Newman or Brando, who each have several books...And Gazzara's career has been an intruiging one. As a member of the Actors Studio, which produced the aforementioned actors along with countless others, his rise to Broadway and Hollywood was quick. He originated Brick in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, and played his first film for Otto Preminger-opposite James Stewart and George C. Scott, among others-in Anatomy of a Murder. But his approach to acting, which is of primary importance to me, was not chronicled. Instead he regales with stories of what and who the people he worked with were like. What the particular country he was shooting in was like, etc., etc. One of his primary sources of regard is his work with John Cassavetes, and it is clear Cassavetes was a major influence and close friend, someone Gazzara owes much, and the process by which they created Husbands and other films is investigated more than any other. Cassavetes too comes out as a more interesting, Larger Than Life guy, while Gazzara's tales of living in Italy, or being in Spain, New York, Hollywood, the Philippines, etc., etc. just made me jealous...I guess I wanted to know more about the life of an Actor who has worked as long as Gazzara has, is still relatively known-but never became a ""star,"" and continues to work, without feeling he is a hack who doesn't take his work seriously..",0
"1227","Great for philosophy, but doesn't inspire!","This book is an nice collection of differing points of views about latinos/hispanics. However it's primarily philisophical. It's more confusing than inspiring. It's great for those studying for a phD, but will not inspire average latinos to action. This book tilts slightly more towards the assimilationist point of view, although a few writers do express some pan-latino thoughts.",0

"1651","Disappointing","A biography about a boy - and a very tough and brave one - who was in battle for such a short time he was spared the continuous horror that veteran survivors (or killed and maimed) of Iwo experienced. He saved the wounding or death of the three other members of his fire team in an apparently instinctive and singular act of self sacrifice. By strict definition, this act was deserving of the Medal of Honor. His terribly painful recovery from wounds received is heart wrenching, but the relatively odd sense of personal glory is in sharp contrast with other accounts of Iwo veterans, or any other battle, I have read. The other accounts I have read generally conclude: War is a horrible thing to experience, and not glorious, but ""I would do it again........."".The recent books I have read will illustrate this contrast:""GOODBYE, DARKNESS"", William Manchester""GOD IS NOT HERE....."", Richard Overton""THE QUIET HERO"", Gary W. Toyn""FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS"", James Bradley""THE LAST LIEUTENANT"", John ShivelyThese men may have entered combat as boys, but they certainly left as men.",0

"1653","Just very odd......","This story should have and COULD HAVE been really good. It presents a great concept, but the story is just so poorly crafted. It is VERY sexist, the prose is stiff, and the plot is dull. I will concede that it was interesting at times; it kept me reading, but I really didn't get much out of it. I can only praise Heinlein for including the ""intelligent conversation"" which takes place after the press conference, where there is a great explantion on why the English language is so difficult to learn. The whole story is just very odd. Do read it though. It's a title to read if you wish to be considered ""well read."" Despite its faults, Valentine Michael Smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten, just as we will never forget Atticus from ""To Kill A Mockingbird.""",0
"1828","Pot Noodle Bushido","This novel of a 17th century samurai's odyssey to Europe starts as a very straightforward story and rather continues that way, but towards the end, Endo does get in a few good points. The style is somewhat pedantic and staid, but easy to read. It's certainly not a zen classic and the story never really gets off the ground or totally convinces. The historical backdrops are paper thin and obvious cut-and-pastes from history textbooks. I must admit I am somewhat baffled by all the rave reviews here. I can only conclude that a lot of people who don't really have much experience of Japan, think they've stumbled upon some sort of motherlode of bushido spirit in this conveniantly Westernized piece of writing by a Japanesese Christian. Remember, not every Japanese woman is a geisha, and not every Japanese writer can wield his pen like a samurai's sword",0

"1989","Very Weak And Unsupported Theory Of Happiness","I appreciate anyone's attempts to examine the deeper nature of life and share that with the rest of us. However, I could see a hole in Csikszentmihalyi's attempt from the beginning. ""In the course of my studies I tried to understand as exactly as possible how people felt when they most enjoyed themselves, and why. My first studies involved a few hundred ""experts""--artists, athletes, musicians, chess masters, and surgeons, in other words, people who seem to spend their time in precisely those activities they preferred.""I'm surely not alone in wondering why on earth one would presume the above professions are strictly happy and ""optimal experience"". Particularly the reference to artists and musicians, who typically have severe struggles with life, and aren't on cloud nine just because some professors might like them in a couple hundred years. That is what I felt was the very weak point of the book--a study of happiness with almost no reference to unhappiness. It goes on to talk about ways to find flow in our ordinary life, while dodging the bullet continually about why if flow was all those great people needed, did they still encounter countless problems and unhappiness.",0
"1090","On Democracy? or On Over Simplification?","This book is great! Assuming you already have a Ph. D. in Political Science. Otherwise this book is best reserved for drop quoting, or light reference. The author shows bias towards the United States' form of  Democracy, as is to be expected in such a book. The simplistic nature makes  the reader annoyed more than informed. The childish approach is suited for  school children, but not as appropriate as other books for real analysis",0

"1648","Soul by Soul by Walter Johnson","The principle question that arises from a reading of ""Soul by Soul"" by Walter Johnson is why was this book written? It is touted as history, yet not only does it lack any original historical material, it  also lacks any discernable historical facts. Rather than history,  ""Soul by Soul"" seems to be a mean-spirited, emotional tract  designed to promote two fundamental ideas: 1. that white people living in  the antebellum South were universally loathsome, brutish and cruel and 2.  that black people living in the antebellum South were universally noble,  good and abused. To support his views, Professor Johnson strings together a  loose collection of repetitious snippets from antebellum abolitionist  literature and excerpts from gossipy litigation proceedings. His personal  contribution is represented by his miraculous ability to enter the psyche  of the book's long deceased characters and divine their true, but unspoken,  motives and thoughts. Quite a feat for any historian!      One loses count  of the number of times that the reader is treated to white people using  their ""probing fingers"" in this book. Fortunately, in between  probes, the reader can be shocked by the ""killing fields of the lower  South,"" the ""historical sexualization of black bodies,"" the  ""slaveholders' inevitable failure to live through the stolen bodies of  their slaves,"" and the ""brutish perogatives of whiteness.""  This is heavy, hate-filled stuff worthy of a TV mini-series but it is out  of place in a supposedly serious history text.       I live in a former  slave quarter in New Orleans. In the antebellum period, this building and  its resident slaves were, interestingly enough, owned by a free black who  was financially ruined in 1863 by the Emancipation Proclamation. As an  amateur historian, I would have thought that a book about the New Orleans  slave market would contain some pertinent historical facts about these  markets. What were their addresses? What percentage of their customers were  black? What percentage were white? How many slaves did the typical New  Orleans household have? How were they fed and clothed? What were their  working hours? These are basic questions that should have been addressed  but instead, the reader is given an emotionally charged, repetitious,  boring rehash of tired, previously published material. In short, this book,  for the most part, reads like a rambling, overly long sermon. Anyone  seeking serious scholarship on the subject of slavery would do well to look  elsewhere and should consider reading the ""Slave Narratives""  compiled by the Federal Writers Project, ""Time on the Cross"" by  Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman and ""The Slave Trade"" by Hugh  Thomas. The first of these is a collection of interviews of former slaves  performed by the W.P.A. in the 1930's. The latter two works contain  original historical research and both deal with the facts of slavery, not  the emotions",0

"1623","The Celts in Ireland","Mr. Cahills book offers an interesting and controversial take on history. He is an excellent and compelling writer, but his differentiation between pre and post diaspora Israelites when discussing the Celts in several of his books is not always clear. It was only the post-Babylonian diaspora Southern Kingdom Israelites who came to be known as Jews, around 500 BC. It was the post-Assyrian diaspora (721 BC) of the larger ten-tribed Northern Kingdom Israelites who became what we today call the Celts. It is they who are both the Island Celts who populated Ireland, Scotland, Wales, etc., and their cousins, the Continental Celts who sacked the Roman Empire under many Celtic tribal names and who make up most of northwest Europe today.  The author could perhaps clarify this part of his presentations on European history by reviewing losttribes.net or any other modern Celtic site based on contemporary archeology.",0
"1199","Muddled","I usually enjoy Ms. Maron's Deborah Knott books very much. The characters are well drawn and give deep insight into Southern life. This one, however, is very flat and the characters are poorly drawn and one dimensional. The first murder doesn't seem to contribut anything to the storyline and is just ""there"". The second one involving Dwight's son (who is a very poorly developed child character) and his ex wife is not very interesting. I devoutly hope this was the nadir of the series and it will improve after this. Probably not, though-I foresee several storylines involving husband/stepmother/stepchild conflicts. Glad I checked it out from the library and didn't purchase it outright..do the same and don't waste your money",0
"1250","Expert Obedience Training for Dogs","Two main comments.  Firstly, the book is mistitled or I misread the meaning of the title and I would be delighted to return it.  This is a book devoted primarily on how to make your dog perform ""tricks"" with much on showmanship.  I have no interest in that but I do have an acute interest in dog obedience relative to the master's care of their puppy and mature dog.  Problems handlers encounter in ""greeting"" of your dog with other dogs and people. Secondly, the book, as written, talks down to the reader and unless you have had some professional experience with dogs, you feel very unqualified to read on.  I felt intimidated by it. ",0

Mr. Kurtz reports that Ms. Gallagher filed a column apologizing to her readers, writing ""I should have disclosed a government contract when I later wrote about the Bush marriage initiative. I would have, if I had remembered it."" She also states she was ""aware vaguely"" that her work was federally funded. It must be vaguely hard to remember being paid $40,000.

"1506","Typical characters, fast plot","Flynn offers up a fast-paced, if unbelievable story.  Unfortunately, character development is paper thin and clearly portrays Flynn's political preferences.  Characters, like Rapp, with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles, have all the answers and are always showing those good-for-nothing politicians how the ""real world"" works.  Meanwhile, Flynn's politicians (the majority of whom are Democrats) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election.  While there are grains of truth in his characters, Flynn consistently goes for the cheap, partisan stereotype.  I was looking for a well-developed political/military thriller.  I'm still looking.",0

Lucy watches as their marriage crumbles and tries to avoid turning into her own mother, who for some reason she hates. I wish we knew a bit more about Lucy, like why she hated her homeland so much.

There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it's obvious that he was involved in the crime. There are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable.

The authors do write well, so I gave it two stars.  But it has under/overtones of the same old myths in erroneous educational ideology that is actually the malaise killing our educational system - dump more money into schools; teachers are underpaid and overworked; high stakes standardized testing is bad.  Folks might be well advised to pick up a copy of Jay P. Greene's ""Educational Myths"" to run a little de-tox on the stuff they read here",0
"1440","Gary - Lost Christianities","Ehrman's work is not for a person of faith. It does not take faith into consideration. It is a wonderful research project based on limited documents available - most forged and falsified; and none which can be validated. I read it as an immediate follow-up to his work ""Lost Scriptures"" - Books that did not make it into the New Testament. I was warned by my minister who is also a Bible scholar and has two Ph.D.'s - and my minister was correct. In Lost Christianities, Ehrman seems to make an effort to discredit our current books of the New Testament by implying that many New Testament books may be false, forged, translated incorrectly, altered to serve a purpose, etc... Ehrman clearly attempts to form a relationship between the New Testament books to those falsified books that did not get into the New Testament. Ehrman's Lost Christianities starts out strong, but ends weak to the point of losing and disinteresting the reader. If for nothing else, it is an attempt to test your faith, but in the end your faith will be strenghtened - if you have faith. The book leads one to believe that the author is as much a Bible critic as he claims to be a scholar. He does present all sides of the New Testament story and it is interesting how the New Testament was formed. However, the lack of confirmed and validated documents will lead one to begin to question if Ehrman is accurate or merely sensationalizing much like the media does. To save you the time and money, simply let your faith answer any questions you may have on the validity of the New Testament and how came to be. Ehrman and other Bible critics (ie., The DeVinci Code) seem to be profiting by creating questions about the truth and validity of the New Testament story. Save your money and give it to your church instead. Gary",0
"1917","I thought I'd come away with useful information...","I bought this book thinking that I would learn something new about the cosmetic industry. Not only did I not learn anything, I came away from the book wondering just how someone could've accumulated all of that information without being able to present it in a better way.This book is packed with non-scientific fluff (using ill-defined terms such as ""toxin"" and making blanket statements with no evidence such as ""Scientists involved [sic] mechanical science--as I like to call it--do not understand plant science, but scientists, who know plant science, understand both [grammar and punctuation left exactly as in the book]."") About 60% of the book is packed with charts and glossaries. And I have to say that this is the worst-edited book I have ever read, with constant typographical errors, misspellings, and apostrophe problems. There just doesn't seem to have been a lot of thought put into the actual execution of this book.Look, I am certainly this book's target audience--I shop at Whole Foods, use organic skin-care products and potions, and work out six times a week. I care about my body and what I put into it. But this book is not a good use of anyone's time or money, as all of its information can be found quite easily (and in most cases with better grammar) on the internet.

"1129","Sacre bleu!","Someone reported all my 3 negative reviews of Daniel Silva books and got them removed! Hmm, I wonder who that could be. I am rather annoyed at this because I spent quite a lot of time detailing why I didn't like one of the books, reasonably, I thought. Apparently, someone had decided that they did not follow the review guidelines. I used no profanities. OK, there were some spoilers, but not more than I usually read in other reviews. Not single worded, no phone numbers, no solicitations, etc. Maybe whoever it was just didn't like my negative review. Well, the last time I checked, the 1st amendment still applies in this country.OK, so let me try to post another review of why I didn't like this book without violating any review guidelines, and I'm not going to spend 30 mins on it like last time. I thought the book was very poorly written and very boring. I struggled through 1/3 of the book but the author could not capture my attention and I decided not to continue to the end. I've read a couple of other Daniel Silva books, but neither one of them could change my mind that he is an author that I don't like. I will not be buying any more of his books",0
"1167","SURVIVING ON THE RUMORS OF ITS SORDID REPUTATION","I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the ""female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..."" Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick.",0
"1268","Great company and leader - Outdated and dubious book","I wavered awhile between three stars and two stars, because a company and entrepreneur as brilliant as Sony and Akio Morita seem to deserve at least three. However, in the end, the book's errors just piled too high. It opens well, with the story of Sony's founding and rise from leaking offices in a half-wrecked department store just after World War II, to becoming one of the world's great companies. This is a fascinating and inspiring story, and Morita tells it with flair.Then, unfortunately, the downward spiral begins. Morita consistently takes his experience at Sony and assumes that every other Japanese company operates the same way, which is a fantastically wrong assertion (as the last thirteen years of Japan's seemingly endless recession have shown). He also frequently takes good basic management techniques, like trusting employees and giving them creative leeway, and tries to brand them as somehow uniquely ""Japanese"".Then there are all the claims which are simply out-and-out false, such as Japan supposedly having the world's best construction technology. (It actually has perhaps the worst in the industrial world, as the Kobe earthquake unfortunately demonstrated.)  Or how Japan is supposedly a nation fanatically devoted to not wasting anything. (Yet it only recently discovered the concept of ""second-hand goods"", instead of throwing nearly-new furniture and clothing away. Plus, Japanese garbage trucks groan under the weight of the world's worst overpackaging.)Reading between the lines, a person can see the roots of so many of the problems that Japan faces today. For example, Morita spends a good deal of words attacking the excess of lawyers in the United States. While this can, of course, sometimes be a serious problem, it also gives U.S. consumers a way to protect themselves. Japan's consumers, on the other hand, without an accessible court system, are almost completely at the mercy of bureaucrats and executives. Complaints about dangerous products or chemicals in drinking water are simply ignored, because they lack any threat of legal action. In another example, Morita praises the ""trust"" and agreements without contracts that exist among Japanese corporations. In reality, this ""trust"" is a death pact, as bankrupt inefficient companies are propped up by their buddies, instead of letting them fall and create openings for fresh and innovative entrepreneurs.Other than the glimpses into Sony's history and corporate culture, this book is only interesting as a museum piece - yet another in the flood of ""Japan is going to take over"" books that came out in the Eighties. Although, of course, considering all the ""Internet companies are going to take over"" books that came out in the Nineties, not even this is a uniquely ""Japanese"" phenomenon. PS: Anyone wanting a healthy reality check about the current state of Japan should read ""Dogs and Demons"" by Alex Kerr.",0

I couldn't even finish reading this book.  It was so bad.  The whole talking car concept was, frankly, just stupid.  This was like watching an episode of Knight Rider, but without David Hasselhoff.  The characters are flat, and the dialogue is stilted and contrived.  I can only believe that Charlotte Hughes did most of the writing, and why on earth would Evanovich attach her name to this?  Needless to say, I will not be reading the rest of the series.  Spend your money on something worth reading",0
"1251","A bone to pick with 'Skeleton Man'!","I've read only a few of Hillerman's previous Leaphorn/Chee novels. I've enjoyed what I've rtead, though they are an acquired taste, and I don't indulge in them very often. I tend to enjoy the earlier, more active years of Joe Leaphorn more interesting than his ' semi-retired unofficial advisor to Jim Chee' phase. From what I gather, 'Skeleton Man' continues a recent trend of disappointment with Hillerman's last few novels. Even without having read the books immediately prior to this one, I can understand that sentiment.'Skeleton Man' starts off with a rather risky premise, tying the story in with the real life collision over the Grand Canyon in 1956. While an author can occasionally pull off a good story with a strong connection to 'real life'(See Nelson De Mille's 'Night Fall'), Hillerman fails here.The story is bogged down with bland and unlikable supporting characters, flimsy motivation, and very little that could really be called 'action'.Chee ends up joining Leaphorn in the background for much of the story.The spiritual and ritualistic aspects of Hillerman's earlier books are, for the most part, glossed over here. Even what should have been a major plot development (Chee's wedding) is overshadowed by Chee have to rescue Manuelito, in the manner of far too many contrived 'Superman rescues Lois' situations. Better to stick with Hillerman's earlier novels. The 'aging athlete past his prime' analogy suits Hillerman, I'm afraid",0
"1767","Willy Loman This Guy Ain'y","This play explores the same old turf as ""Death of a Salesman"", but it does so with much less satisfaction and much less character development.  Eddie is no Willy Loman, though, and the play suffers immediately from a lack of a central, driving force like Willy.  Parts of the play seem borrowed from Tennessee Williams, and they don't seem to work in this context.  There is some business about the romance of the Old World Italy versus the New World of Opportunity on the docks of New York, and it is the only topic that is at all explored well, if still unsatisfactorily.  Eddie's dreams are represented in his pretty niece, Catherine; and unlike Willy Loman's uncle, she is still an attainable dream. That makes Eddie's life seem all the more petty, in comparison to Willy's: he longs wearily not after what he could have had, but after what he can never have, as he is already married.  The death scene at the end of the play also seems like a forced, tacked on ending, and Alfieri's entire presence is a more or less unsuccessful stage gimmick.  There are better plays by Miller, and many better plays by others",0

I had stopped reading her books because I have been sick of the same old thing - I borrowed Miracle from a friend hoping it would indeed be a miracle and would be original Danielle Steel -I was completely wrong.

"1906","The Egotistical Master","Mailer tells us a lot we don't want to know about. It's the gloomy long tale of an egocentric writer's acceptance of the ups and downs of his metier. He gives his biased opinions on things he knows and things he doesn't know about. All the negative aspects of his persona are laid out. Still, it must have taken some bravery to lay out some of them. Or else he needed the money. Truth sells, even if it is a very mediocre unfocused book, and quite un-useful. It should have been titled ""Me and My Books, Some thoughts on me and my writing""",0

"1240","Reluctantly dragged along with Frances Mayes","This book really irritated me. I loved Mayes's previous books and was really looking forward to reading this one. The concept, a year of traveling to different locations, seemed like it would be really interesting combined with Mayes' fresh perspectives, enthusiasm for discovery, feisty opinions and poetic descriptions. But somehow it didn't work. I get the sense that her heart wasn't really in this book. Maybe because the trips were taken over a span of five years, and cobbled together? Or because there's so much `padding' - endless quotes from her own or other people's writing. When she liked the place, her descriptions feel artificially enthusiastic, almost as if the book was paid for by the chamber of commerce. I got tired of reading that she could live there, or could imagine taking her grandson there, or wishes she was born there, or that it's SO much better than San Francisco. Where she doesn't live anymore, and hasn't for years. There are also too many stories about refreshing local characters who think Frances Mayes is the nicest, most tasteful, most interesting person they've ever met. Especially since these people tend to be waiters, cab drivers, rug salesmen or others whose business depends on charming the tourists. Most of the book consists of sneering at her fellow Americans, or talking about people's personal appearance. This is boring and clichï¿½d - and if you like that kind of thing, Bill Bryson does it better. There's also way too much name dropping (she's always mentioning ""my friend so-and-so, the famous ____""). What happened to the ordinary, financially stretched, middle-aged college professor? She seems to be taking on the persona of a celebrity. She doesn't want to be crowded in with a group, doesn't want to associate with ordinary tourist types - now she deserves the VIP treatment. This is definitely a change from her previous books.I think when it comes right down to it, there's too much Frances Mayes in this book. I thought I liked her, but what I really like is her writing style. It can still be magical - when she gets her ego out of the way. But when she puts herself front and center, she becomes more tedious and pretentious than interesting. Now I'm sorry I read this book, because I'm afraid it will spoil my enjoyment of the earlier ones.",0

"1361","Fully developed characters are in danger of extinction...","This is my 3rd McDermid novel, I previously read 'Mermaids Singing' and 'Wire in the Blood.' McDermid writes good prose but in this 3rd novel I see dangerous repetitions in character types which, if repeated in the next Tony Hill/Carol Jordan book will make that one my last purchase. Generally McDermid paints female police officers as brighter, more diligent and more intuitive than their male counterparts, as well as more often homosexual. The men, with the exception of leading man Tony Hill, are mostly all egotistical, back-stabbing, power-hungry morons of the lowest order, while Hill is rendered impotent -- a redundant bit of emasculation since all the other males are castrated of their moral fiber. The slow mating dance between Hill and Jordan gets a lot of buildup and little payoff. And in this book, the serial killer and the surrounding hunt for him are as limply portrayed as Dr. Hill. The emotional connection between Hill and the killers in the two previous books is missing here, making the entire killer plot read like an afterthought. And the real villain -- not the serial killer but a drug-pushing / illegal-immigrant smuggler loses character focus as the reader is given reason to sympathize with him as well as with the killer. The climactic scenes involving the capture of one villain and the death of another are without any sense of thrill or danger. I was extremely disappointed with this book",0
"1220","The ugliest chronicle of a true legend of our time.","The very title for the book - ""I Con"" - despite its cleverness, should reveal the lack of any objectivity, or class for that matter, from the authors, Jeffrey S. Young & William L. Simon.I could best describe this book as a shoddy pastiche of ambiguous-sounding facts, poor research, colored by a palpable disdain for [arguably the most interesting legend of our time] Steve Jobs. What is really distasteful is that this antipathy of the authors towards Steve Jobs, seems 'personal'; which, in a democratic sense, may be alright i guess, [but only] UNTIL facts begin to wear thin, and the research seems doctored, leaving the rants sounding hollow, unsavory and shrill.And the facts aren't well-strung together either!From the very opening description in the book, which overdramatizes and harps on about the return of a ""reformed"" Steve Jobs, to Apple in 1997 (as though the most unfathomably impossible phenomenon in the history of humankind had occurred), to the careful selection of maliciously undertoned quotations, and quite often blatant slanders about Jobs, the book appears to be a collation of 'hate diaries' maintained by two wannabe authors, whose sole purpose in writing this book seems to be to fuel an anti-Steve sentiment among its readers!If you happen to be one of those people, who finds some twisted pleasure in those idle conversations that involve scandalmongering [especially Steve Jobs], then this book should provide ample fuel for your negative energy",0
"1043","Pathetic","I bought this book while rushing through an airport terminal needing something to read on the plane.  Not one of my better decisions.  Very wordy, and the dialogue is so clipped and stilted it's totally absurd -- reminds me of the way the cops talked in ""Dragnet.""  We are talking zero development of characters.  Perhaps Mr. Woods feels he doesn't need to give any depth to characters that he's been writing about in previous books.  Well, he's wrong.  You basically just don't care about these people.  They aren't real, and they talk weird.  Not much action either, unless you count actions like:  they got in the car; they got in the boat; they got in the plane.  You get the picture.  This is another case of a well-known author throwing something together so he can get it on the newsstand and rob you of your money.  Don't fall into his trap like I did.  There are a lot better books out there.",0
"1408","Good book but in the wrong way","As a romantic comedy, Star Wars is a failure.  As a science fiction film, the Annie Hall is a complete disappointment.  Whatever other merits these movies might have, there are definitely areas that they are lacking.  Which brings me to The Rough Guide to Cult Movies:  as a reference book, it is highly suspect.  What's notable is that Annie Hall fails as sci-fi because it doesn't try to be that genre; The Rough Guide fails at the very category it aspires to.  Which is too bad, because it is often an interesting read.The failure starts at the beginning of the book with a definition of cult movies that is so broad as to be meaningless.  We then a series of chapters representing various ""genres"", some of which are valid (science fiction, westerns, horror), some of which are ridiculous (Animals, Food, Nuns) and some of which are not even true genres (dubbed, independent, straight-to-video).  After this, we get various miscellaneous topics that are thrown in without rhyme or reason, such as a list of top movie grosses followed by presidential movie trivia.The movie descriptions are often amusing, although there are numerous errors (such as misstating Geoffrey Rush's role in Pirates of the Caribbean), even more omissions (every reader will find his own; one example is that Unforgiven is missing from Westerns) and plenty of movies that are really miscategorized but seem only placed in a specific genre to fill it out.What saves this book is, even though it fails as a reference book, it is nonetheless entertaining.  I am therefore giving this two stars instead of one.  It's a rather useless book, especially if you want to learn more about movies, but if you do pick it up, it is probably the most entertaining two-star book that you're ever likely to read. ",0

"1486","King officially jumps the shark","This is perhaps the most disappointing King book I have ever read (and considering that I have read ""Desperation"" and ""Insomnia"" that is saying a lot).  The storyline was okay until the author lost me by inserting himself into the story.  I have no problem with characters from other stories popping up but for the author to become a character was over the top.  The only thing I found interesting about King as a character was the diaries that appear as the last chapter of the book.I thought this was a blatant attempt to market his other books by having them referenced throughout the book.  I would guess that anybody that reaches Song of Susannah has read is a faithful reader of King and does not need to be reminded of all his previous works (which as of late have been bad with the exception of ""The Green Mile:  Hey, Steve, if I wanted to read an infomercial I'll read my junk mail.I cannot wait to read the last Dark Tower book so I can be put out of my misery",0

"1975","Try that again?","First a little background... I'm 53 with a preteen son. I'm not quite a Luddite.  I make my living from an online business that I own and operate. Our ""big"" present to our son last Xmas was a computer -- one he and I were going to build from scratch. The main use of the computer was going to be video games and school work. We gave our son a budget (not big by gamer PC standards) to shop for the parts. I've read a few books recently on the gaming ""culture"" to better understand it. This book came highly recommended from reviews here, so I read it.My reaction to the book? It took a while, but I finally realized it felt like I was reading a study paid for and prepared on behalf of the video game industry. There are lots of great statistics, but rather flimsy rational defending extensive video game playing and how it's successfully preparing gamers to succeed in the future.  I did learn a few things. I got a dose of reality about why it seems like everyone under 35 plays video games extensively. I see that the *gamer generation* has a lot to offer. I also seriously wonder about the gaps in what they have to offer.A main thesis of the book is that gamers learn how to think and figure things out, because video games are about figuring out how to beat the game. Interesting, since by the examples cited, it mostly appears to be trial and error with no significant logic involved. I call it learn by trying anything, as opposed to learn by thinking. Both have their place.Supposedly, gamers are more willing to take (theoretically controlled) risks as well. Somehow the authors see the dot.com boom (and bust) as an endorsement of the future of business in the hands of gamers (who largely ran the dot.coms). I see a different story than the authors from those days of yore.I could go on, but I think you get the point. The book says little (nothing?) about how video games are helping gamers learn math, science, or reading. Personally, I believe those skills/knowledge are MUCH more important to a person's future than the ability to learn thru trial and error. Maybe the conclusions of the authors will prove to be correct. I hope so. But personally, I'm concerned for any business that runs on the pure gamer mentality that I understand to be endorsed by the book.",0

"1894","Awakening is Inferior to Ascension","White Wolf wanted to revitalize a mature product line by rewriting it and they had problems with the old system that deserved fixing. They did an excellent job on the core rules and the game mechanics are overall the best they've ever been. One of the flaws of MAGE:Ascension was that it is dominated by the struggle between the Technocracy and the Traditions, in a manner that reflected Vampire:Masquerade's clan structure and Sabbat vs Camarilla. One of the flaws of Vampire:Masquerade was that it had this whole history of ""Caine as the first vampire and the Anti-Diluvians as the founders of the clans"", that overshadowed the game. In Mage:Ascension, Mages saw themselves as having evolved over time and that history had been re-written by the technocracy, so who really knew about the past? In Awakening they took exactly what they were trying to jettison from Vampire and put it into Mage with the creation of Atlantis and the Exarchs. The Societies that replace the traditions are not as interesting. The replacement of Avatars with Towers doesn't make sense to me. The eternal struggle theme remains with the Exarchs but seems a lot less important than the struggle over the consensus in Ascension.Awakening is chock full or rotes. For, Mage in a LARP, rotes are essential, shifting emphasis to rotes improves the compatibility of table top and live action systems, but detracts from the table top experience where Mages can do almost anything. They split the Entropy Sphere into Death and Fate, which kind of makes sense, except that Death has too much overlap with Spirit. I'm going to use the new Mechanics with the old world in my new campaign.The new Mage setting doesn't inspire me like the old one did. While the new Vampire and Werewolf settings may catch on, I think the new Mage is going to be a flop -- after the core book I don't expect to purchase any more of the supplements.",0

"1551","LOST fans, don't bother.  Choose ""Watership Down"" or other","Fans of the ABC-TV show ""LOST"" will probably be buying ""Our Mutual Friend"" in droves after having seen Desmond keeping it to be the ""last book [I] ever [read]"".  Since I did not have to buy it, having purchased a full set of Dickens years ago, I immediately set out to read it.What a disappointment it was!  Dickens wrote it on an installment basis publishing it in a magazine over a 19 month period.  One cannot avoid a sneaking suspicion while reading it that it is, just a bit, perhaps, 'padded'.  Any good editor could have tightened it up at least 200 pages. Dickens' work is melodrama, but some of it is just more overwrought than is compatible with good art.  As Oscar Wilde said of 'The Old Curiosity Shop', ""I simply cannot read of the death of Little Nell without laughing.""  'OMF' goes quickly down to this level of bathos and remains there to the last sentence. Even worse is the ending.  Some endings just can't help but feel contrived; and Dickens, having gotten a large number of his characters into drastic positions, pulls so many strange- colored rabbits out of his hat that the reader simply feels cheated.All of this may seem rather harsh from someone who was willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for ""The Complete Oxford Illustrated Dickens"" but I assure you that my only concern is for you, gentle reader.  Unless you are possessed of adequate time to read the whole of Dickens' oeuvre or are required to read ""Our Mutual Friend"", I would, instead, direct you to Dickens' far superior works:  'David Copperfield', 'Oliver Twist', 'Pickwick Papers'.  If you are looking for 'LOST' reading material, I would refer you to 'Watership Down' (Excellent), 'The Stand' (by Stephen King, entertainment, not literature), 'The Dark Tower' series (by Stephen King, entertainment, not literature, and similar to 'Our Mutual Friend' possessed of a fatally flawed ending) or a review of philosophy like 'Locke, Rousseau and Hume'.Namaste and Good Luck,AKA Redemption Isle on TheFuselage.co",0

First of all, the authors so redundantly use the word ""whilst"" and the phrase ""rules of the game"" that it really gets on your nerves. My classmates all agree with me on this point. Second, speaking of getting on your nerves, half of what these authors say is, ""...as we talked about in the previous chapter"" or ""as we'll talk about in the next chapter"". There is so much redundant language in this book that it really could be condensed to about 25% of its size, and hell, it probably could simply be a chapter in the text for some other course. Third, the authors should win a Pulitzer prize for flowery language. They seem more interested in impressing me than educating me. Their sentences are far too long. They don't know the meaning of clear and concise, and I think they should all go back to English Composition 101.

If ever a topic begged for a case-study approach, it's this one, and this book is not the answer. Save your money, and beg your instructor not to use this text. ",0
"1209","Thin characterization","I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time",0
"1541","lots of fill...little thrill","As a piece of entertainment, this book falls flat. Way flat.  There is a story here, but mundane sub-plots (including the love story) are thrown in in an attempt to fill the pages to make it a book.  I found myself skipping pages - lots of them - to get to the point.  Overall, very disappointing. ",0
"1012","The Half-way mark","This is the sixth book in the Left Behind series. It is also the first one in the series I did not finish in one sitting. It did not flow as well as the others, so as to lend itself to a complete reading in one evening. The book also spends a lot of time re-telling what we read in previous books. I felt this time like I read half a novel.The book starts in the thirty-eighth month into the tribulation. But most of the characters seem a little too self serving in this book. Allowing their own desires to guide their actions. Whether that desire be derived from rage, revenge, self pity, or even guilt. Rayford spends most of his time focusing on Hattie or his desire to kill the Anti-Christ. Though I do like the description of the handgun that Rayford procures. And when the time comes for the assassination, there are a few characters to chose from. The book ends in an old time cliff hanger where you are left guessing who it is that assassinated the Anti-Christ. Stay tuned for the next volume. I have read this far, so I will finish the series. Though most people my find this book suspensful, I did not",0
"1654","Three Junes -Where did They Get That Name?","Sometime ago I read my Sunday paper and noted that ""Three Junes"" was listed as a popular book choice.  The title sounded interesting so I bought it.  That was 2 months ago and I am still trying to get through the paperback edition.  It is difficult to follow the timeline, to understand the characters and where they fit, and to get involved in the storyline.  I will finish the book because that's my style.

"2000","It's just ""Reefer Madness"" ","And you shouldn't inhale.Several reviewers have ecstatically proclaimed this book and movie to be an eye-opening, truth-revealing work, but those who are credulous enough to think they learn history through agenda-focused books and films like ""Hunting"" need to go back and see other ""documentaries"" like ""Triumph Of The Will"", ""The Eternal Jew"" or ""Reefer Madness"".Let's be honest, people. This book was written by a strongly pro-Clinton columnist and the movie was produced by well-known FOB (Friend Of Bill) Harry Thompson.  It's about as objective as the factually challenged ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", a work that Moore himself now calls ""satire"".  (By the way, I'll bet you didn't know that many Middle Easterners who have seen Moore's movie are outraged at the shallow, stereotypical and racist image he presented of their people and culture.)  The point is, whether intentional or just laziness these dime-a-dozen political books typically contain significant misrepresentations.  If you're already a member of the author's congregation, you won't care.  You'll shout ""hallelujah!"" and say that ""Hunting"" has given the world Great Truths.  But clear thinkers understand that it's foolish to uncritically accept the representations in either this book or the followup movie.",0
"1955","No Way","Anyone who knows me would tell you I truly enjoy reading.  I am an avid reader known to finish an interesting book within hours. It took me two weeks to get past the first seven chapters of this book. The story just could not keep my interest.  I felt no real affinity to any of the characters.  I have other books by this author and come away with an interst in what would happen next with her lead characters.  She writes with real emphasis on how characters interact with each other and usually leaves you wanting more.  In the case of this novel I just didn't feel it.  Her other novels will not leave you dissapointed. Ugly ways is not a good example of the Ansa's true talent as a writer.  If you have not done so try her other novels.

The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, ""thinking"" to themselves.  Wow, is this bad.  ""Message in a Bottle"" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then.  You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed.",0

"1101","Long on Verbiage, Short on Plot, and Ultimately Pointless","The book jacket for ""The Ruins"" offers a can't-miss premise:  a group of post-grad American tourists at play in Mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among Mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger.  It's the stuff of great Summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach.  But 319 pages later, the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket.  Almost immediately, you'll notice that Smith's writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting.  However, despite the endless stream of words, his descriptions are often threadbare.  Plus, there are no chapter breaks, which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue.  Next, the characters themselves begin to fall flat.  There are only really two couples to keep track of, and yet it's difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them.  There is little to keep you interested in what they're doing or why they might be doing it.  Smith's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts.  This seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters' actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam.  By the end of the book, the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them.  And for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as Mayan mythology or archeological lore, forget it.  Aside from language barriers with the locals, there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn't have been set in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains, the Saharan desert, or anywhere else.  The danger posed has nothing to do with Mexico, archeology or mythology at all.  Ah yes, the danger posed.  Well, I can't say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - that's how thin the plot is.  The numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right.  Suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is (and you'll realize it well before any of the well-educated characters do), it's a real eye-roller, as if to say ""I read this many pages for THIS?"".By the time the story concludes, it's more irritating than suspenseful.  The characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you'll start rooting against them.  Eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action, but even aside from being misdirected, it's too little too late.  This book could have been an adventure, a supernatural thriller, a survival tale, or a horror screenplay.  It could have even taken the high road as an examination on people's reactions to situations of extreme stress:  some take the lead, even enjoying the challenge, while others whither into a shell of hopelessness.  But none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort. ",0
"1587","Not Recommended","Having read (and thoroughly enjoyed) Levitt's Freakonomics, I picked up ""Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life"" looking for more of the same. Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed. I get the impression the author intended to write a Freakonomics-type book, but was only able to come up with 40 pages of material (located at the end of the book). Facing an irate publisher, he then filled in the initial 290 pages with his old Economics lecture notes. As a result, readers who have taken an elementary economics course will find much of the material repetitive, while those who have not will most likely find the material too confusing to be of any real use. (Despite the glowing accolades on the cover, the author's explanations are no better than those available in a standard textbook.)The author also posits end-of-chapter questions for the reader to ruminate upon, but does not provide any answers. Aside from formal textbooks where such questions are intended to be assigned to students, such tactics are unconscionable. Of course, the author may be priming the pump for sales of a ""Hidden Order Supplement"".A final negative point is the author's tone, which is frequently condescending towards the reader (e.g. telling the reader they would not understand the math behind a given theory, so it will not even be presented). While this may be true for a layperson reading the book, being talked down to certainly does nothing to build their confidence or cultivate their interest in the subject matter.Overall, if you can borrow a copy from a friend or a library, the last 40 pages are worth reading. Otherwise, save your time and money.Reviewer's background:B.Sc. (Computing Science & Mathematics)M.B.A. (Finance & Marketing)Ph.D. (Finance)",0
"1230","Worthless and Disproven","Keynes was no doubt an influential economist.  His theories and 'expertise' on economics influenced the post-New Deal economic policies of the United States and the internationalist wealth redistribution schemes like IMF.  However, his ideas on economics failed miserably and it was application of Keynesian ideas that wrecked so much havoc on the U.S. particularly in the 1970s with the stagflation (an inflationary recession with unemployment which was theoretically impossible accordingly to Keynesism.)  We have Keynes to thank for budget deficits and the nebulous idea that we can spend ourselves into prosperity through the largesse of the federal government.  Read Planning for Freedom or Socialism by Ludwig von Mises instead",0

"1068","Mandelbrot repeatedly claims standard models...","...are incorrect and that his fractal models are much better. Of course if his models were worth more than the paper they're written on Mandelbrot wouldn't have to write books like this because he'd be cleaning out everyone else's wallets on the stock market. In particular, if it's true that extreme events are more unlikely than most people think then he could easily exploit this with a suitable derivative. But the fact is, Mandelbrot doesn't know anything that countless other traders don't already know. So instead Mandelbrot is forced to resort to telling people how smart he is through his books rather than actually being smart enough to make a killing on Wall Street.But I am glad I read this book. Having seen Mandelbrot 'on tour' a few years ago I developed a strong prejudice against him. But reading this book has convinced me that my prejudice is entirely justified. He can never just state a fact. Instead he always has a to phrase it as ""my work shows that..."" or ""I demonstrated that..."" even if he makes the same claim again and again. If he can try to take credit for other people's work he'll do so. He even managed to find someone to write an introduction for the book who was prepared to refer to the Levy distribution as the Mandelbrot-Levy distribution. The most egregious example of self-aggrandisement has to be the caption to a picture of the Brooks-Metelsky-Mandelbrot set where he mentions that two mathematicians only scaled part way up his 'Everest' of this set and received Fields medals for this work - the implication of course being that Mandelbrot has actually seen the view from the summit. Disgustingly he doesn't even deign to mention the names of these mathematicians.One time I criticised Mandelbrot publicly and someone responded by pointing out how many peer reviewed papers he had published so he can't be all bad. But in this book Mandelbrot actually reveals to us how he used his social network to work around the peer review system. Astonishing!I think it's also worth pointing out that there are some interesting ideas in this book and so it's not completely valueless. But I found the discussion of multifractal time methods (which make up a large part of the book) to generate plausible looking but fake price charts to be a bit pointless. I work in computer graphics and use similar methods to generate random surface detail all the time, but it doesn't mean I have a deep understanding of the statistics of random surfaces. It just means I know how to fool the eye",0
"721","A seductive page turner, but lacking something....","First off, I have to admit: I am 22 years old and read the entirety of this book in one 7 hour sitting on my way to Paris.I picked up the novel out of sheer curiosity and personal research for my job. I work at Barnes & Noble and am in charge of both the Teen and Children's sections. When our store sold out of New Moon within a week of initially getting the book, my curiosity was piqued -- I felt I had to give its predecessor a try so I knew what the hype was about and could give an honest opinion about the book.Now here I sit and I have finished both Twilight and New Moon. I have to admit -- Meyer has a talent. Both books I read at breakneck speed, barely stopping to eat or sleep. Her prose is smooth and easy, accompanied by a plot that I found engrossing. I went back after reading Twilight and re-read my favorite sections more than once. The love story was hypnotizing and surprisingly seductive. I definitely plan on recommend this book, mainly to teenage girls who will swoon over Edward.However, I only gave the book four stars. While I enjoyed it immensley as I read the novel, a few things bothered me upon looking back: 1) While Meyer deinitely has a talent for writing an engaging novel full of beautiful descriptions, the character descriptions at times felt extremely lazy. If I had to read one more time about Edward's marble, angelic face (what, exactly, does that mean??), his liquid topaz eyes, or how Bella glared at Edward, I thought I was going to pitch the book down the aisle of the plane.2) I'm not sure I buy their romance. It was heartstopping and climactic during the read, but honestly, what DOES he see in her? If Bella keeps asking that question to herself, maybe her audience shoud seriously consider it. 3)Bella herself bothered me. I found Bella to be horribly dependent on Edward to the point that I got irritated with her. And her constantly having to catch her breath around Edward -- Puh-leeze. Be a woman! Stand on your own feet! She never fully developed into a character for me since she revolved solely around Edward, something that I, as a self-sustained woman, cannot connect with.And lastly, 4)Bella wants so desperately to become a vampire, but that seems like it could pose a problem between herself and Edward. Since I haven't seen any evidence that Edward likes Bella for any other reason than that she smells wonderful (a scent that she has because she is human and has blood coursing through her veins, mind you), what happens when she no longer smells good? Meyer is really going to have to prove to me that Edward actually loves Bella for other reasons than her smell, otherwise it will be completely unbelievable if Bella turns into a vampire and Edward is still attracted to this ordinary girl...Although the plot has its shortcomings, I still thoroughly enjoyed it and that is why I give it four stars. I will read the next one when it comes out, and any other subsequent after that, for the simple reason that the books are entertaining and Edward is so dang alluring",1

"324","Top notch SF","I was surprised at some of the poor reviews given this book and have an idea that these stem from those picking up books from a list of Nebula Award winners. This book is not at all your typical SF story, indeed it feels much more like a mainstream story with some SF aspects than it does an SF story. I'm an avid reader of both science fiction as well as mainstream fiction, so this holds a good deal of appeal for me.Griffith's prose is wonderful and showcases a beauty of language seldom seen in science fiction. Her characterization is also near perfect. I won't spend time discussing the plot as that's been handled amply by the other reviewers, but I will echo one other person's thoughts: The storyline that has Lore working at a sewage plant is, surprisingly, every bit as engrossing as the ones that deal with her kidnapping and her high society upbringing. To me, that says a good deal about Griffith's talent as a writer.As for the sex scenes, which some people describe as being nearly constant in the book, there are actually about four or five scenes taking up somewhere around ten pages of the book (not each, but in total). Additionally, they're not placed in the story without purpose.Overall, an excellent book. Personally, I'm quite glad that it won a Nebula. It's certainly desereving",1
"506","Well Done Book, yet...","I enjoyed Robert Webber's book and have enjoyed hearing him speak as well. At a recent speaking engagement he echoed my own concern over the ""fate"" of the church in America. So much ""commodification"" has happened in the church that one wonders if anyone knows what it truly means to be ""ecclesia""? Although I agree with much of what he says and am part of a liturgical church (The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod which utilizes the church calendar and has had a strong emphasis on liturgy - - - the church body which Webber received his doctorate from), my question is are we truly called to ""change"" the church in order to meet the people where they are at? I agree with his assessments yet I question the reasonings behind doing it. Do we begin to emphasize certain things to the demise of others, just because the culture would be more ""prone"" to come to the church? Or does the church remain faithful to its calling despite the changing tides of culture? Our self-centered culture always asks the question ""What does this mean for me?"", and this has been a active question in the church for sometime. I believe the question that we should be asking is how does God give meaning to me, or what do I mean to God? Our focus needs to be off of ourselves and onto the Lord of the cosmos",1
"722","Police procedural and medical thriller wrapped up in a bow!","Boston is trembling under the shadow of a serial murderer with a notably gruesome method of dispatching his victims - brutal, savage rape, an obviously knowledgeable, skillful removal of the uterus while the victim still lives with the coup de grace coming as a slashed throat and severing of the carotid artery! Little wonder the media has awarded him the moniker ""The Surgeon"". In the course of their investigations, detectives Thomas Moore and Jane Rizzoli discover an earlier case with a virtually identical MO in Savannah in which the murderer, Andrew Capra, was ultimately killed by a stalwart would-be victim who fought back and shot him before he could finish the job! They are startled to discover that the surviving victim, Dr Catherine Cordell, is a noted cardiac surgeon currently practicing in a major Boston hospital, and beyond all belief in the possibility of coincidences, she appears to be the target of the now active killer!Once again, Gerritsen has unerringly brought her intimate knowledge of medicine and the hospital milieu to the table. But, contrary to what one might fairly expect from Gerritsen's past work, has successfully served up a compelling investigative police procedural which lovingly details the forensics, the pathology, the profiling and the gut-wrenching detail in the relentless task force style search for a psychopathic serial murderer! Several superbly paced sub-plots are inextricably woven into one another as the story unfolds - Cordell's slow recovery from the assault she endured two years ago and her halting re-integration into life and the hospital work force; Jane Rizzoli's bristly temperament as the lone Boston female homicide detective and her work-life struggles against the ""old boy"" attitude of the police force; Thomas Moore's extended grieving period over the untimely loss of his dearly loved wife and the difficulties he faces as he recognizes his entirely inappropriate blossoming romantic feelings for Catherine Cordell; the task force style investigation of ""The Surgeon"" and his relationship with the long dead Georgia killer; and, Cordell's daily life in the cardiac ward and the emergency room of the hospital and the brilliantly described relationship she maintains with her working partner, Dr Peter Falco.Not only does Gerritsen handle all of this with skill and aplomb but, with every passing page and each successful murder, she ratchets up the suspense as we realize the killer is taunting the police, honing his skills and reaching for Catherine Cordell as his ultimate target. Yet he constantly remains one step ahead of the investigation.A great addition to the library if, like me, you love your easy reading page-flipping thrillers!Paul Weis",1

The writing style is clear and refreshingly down to earth,funny, yet foreboding and diary-like in its presentation.Burroughs clearly transmits via humor and self awareness the many dimensions of this destructive addiction and the problems that can come with it, especially the limited usefulness of rehab.The story itself is pretty hip with a good look inside the mind of what we could easily call, ""a hard core drinker"" as he anticipates the ""next one"".Passages describe a variety of interpersonal dilemmas,job and sexual conundrums.Dry is also a good insightful look at how the treatees view the treaters and how quickly they can size up weaknesses and exploit them.This is a page turner but it does drag a bit in the middle, yet has a strong finish.An earlier work 'Running With Scissors' was apparently good enough for Hollywood, so take a shot with DRY.After all, when your liquor bottles occupy more living space in your place than you do, it might be time to slow down,stop and get a copy of Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, and a copy of Dry.

While the history is too rich and detailed to be dealt within a book with this scope, this is a remarkably readable and valuable thumbnail of the currents of the public discourse on gay life, and should provide any reader with an understanding of how crucial and new gay civil rights really are.

"382","Never travel the same route twice!","Ibn Batuta describes his encounters with peoples and lands west of his native Tangiers (Morocco) in the 14 C. By avoiding to travel the same route twice, he comes to the same places a number of times (Baghdad, Delhi) spinning and zigzagging his ways through mountains and seas. As he explores with brio this world, he unfolds himself and as in most cross-cultural encounters, this maybe one of the most interesting features of the book. He accepts miraculous events with a candor I have not found in any other Middle Age traveler of those lands (from Marco Polo to the Jesuits). He gives little description of the way people live in the places he visits - which I regret - apart from detailed descriptions of the gowns and other garments he is given by some of the Sheikhs of the places he visits. The descriptions of how those sheikhs succeeded to govern illustrate how (extremely) fragile power was and is in those regions. Names are sometimes difficult to relate to those we know - which is regretful. Don't follow Ibn Batuta's advice, read (and enjoy) the book twice",1

Included with the disc is a 10-page booklet containing song titles/credits, song lyrics, band pictures, one 'gavel' drawing containing  band member faces, and thank you's. This is Metallica's 4th studio album. All songs written by Hetfield, Hammett, Ulrich and/or Newsted. Recorded at One On One Studios, Los Angeles, CA.

Label - Elektra.COMMENTS: ""...And Justice For All"" was the last classic Metallica album of the 80's. It was also their final attempt at thrash metal (once the 90's rolled around and producer Bob Rock entered the picture, the band took a more ""mainstream"" metal approach). The majority of songs are long with complex riffs... borderline progressive. Let me first say that for years, this disc sat on my shelf. I thought it was over-produced; I didn't like Ulrich's snare drum (sounded cheap and tinny) or his double bass (sounded shallow and metallic - partly due to a coin taped to the drum skin where the foot pedal hit); Newsted's bass was nonexistent (the standard explanation for this combines Newsted's absence from the mixing sessions where he could have voiced his opinion, and the lingering issue of his ""newness"" within the band following the death of Burton); there were three songs that I just could not get into (""Eye Of The Beholder"", ""The Shortest Straw"" and lightning fast ""Dyers Eve""); and the articles I read about the 3 original band members hazing and not accepting newcomer Newsted was infuriating... call if fun, call it pranks, call it cruel - Newsted simply did not deserve this kind of treatment. Newsted (or anyone else who took the job) had two choices - put up with the crap or leave. From the outside looking in, Burton's loss was tragic, but the way Hetfield/Ulrich/Hammett handled the situation afterwards seemed uncalled for. As far as ""...And Justice For All"" is concerned though, it's taken a decade to grow on me and finally realize there are some brilliant songs here. In my opinion, ""One"" is one of Metallica's finest songs in their entire catalog. ""One"" has an awesome slow beginning, tells a great story of an injured soldier, and ends in fine metal thrash form (not to mention one of the more memorable MTV videos)... all in all featuring great guitar work (intro, rhythm and solos). ""Blackened"" is an underrated gem of an opener. ""To Live Is To Die"" is the other masterpiece (almost 10 minutes long) - riffs and spoken words written by Cliff Burton (his last written testament) - this song has great riffs and 7 minutes of jamming before any vocals... reminiscent of something taken right off ""Master Of Puppets"". The title track also resembles something from ""Puppets"". ""...And Justice For All"" chart success - hitting #6 on Billboard's ""Top 200 Albums"" from 1988, as well as the song ""One"" hitting #35 on Billboard's Hot 100. There's good and bad here... this album is still considered a classic and essential. If not only for the songs ""One"", ""Blackened"" and ""To Live Is To Die"" (4 stars).",1
"176","A Helpful Memoir for Women","Liz Perle does a really nice job in ""Money, A Memoir"" of weaving statistics, professional studies, and other people's experiences with her own personal experience and insight.  While many parts of her book sound familiar (e.g., women shopping when they're in a slump) it does look below the surface at some of the root causes of our unhealthy relationship with money and why we differ vastly from men in that regard.  The other thing I appreciated about the book was that Perle doesn't claim to have all the answers, and explains how she was able to find a happy medium in her relationship with money, which to me sounded like something I could attempt and achieve.  Thanks, Liz for a very important memoir that women of all ages should read",1

It is the perfect thing to read when you're in that  post-breakup stay-in-bed-in-your-pyjamas-and-eat-ice-cream stage.  Beautiful, beautiful work. If all you have to complain about this book is  that you didn't learn how to properly can, you're missing the point. Pay  the extra 5 bucks and spring for the lovely hardcover -- it's worth it. I  cannot say enough wonderful things about this scrumptious, funny, simple  little insightful jewel! Mwah",1
"445","Photographer as Artist","George DeWolfe sees the photographer as an artist, not a technician, yet his book provides the technical knowledge and shows how to use Photoshop to create consistently high quality fine art prints.  Writing for the experienced photographer with a basic knowledge of Photoshop, DeWolfe begins by showing the photographer, with many examples, how to evaluate an image and decide what adjustments will bring out its special qualities.  The experienced photographer has always used his or her understanding of how light, luminosity and color give life to an image, and has traditionally used various techniques in the darkroom to enhance them.  DeWolfe begins by training the eye of the artist to see these elements and understand how they work.  After showing the reader how to truly see the image and decide how to fine-tune it, DeWolfe then gives us a very detailed digital workflow which, once mastered, allows the photographer to produce excellent prints on a consistent basis. The workflow is clarified by many screen shots showing Photoshop techniques and before/after image adjustments. Those who think visually will find these particularly helpful.DeWolfe's approach is to use the simplest techniques that can produce consistently fine results.  (Some Photoshop users will be surprised by his use of the history brush instead of masking; as a photographer who uses this tool, I appreciate its simplicity and controlled results.)  His focus is not on ""tips-and-tricks in Photoshop"", but on how to get the best possible prints in the simplest, most straightforward way.  While a first reading gives valuable insights, the book's true value becomes evident when the photographer uses the workflow on his or her own images, and practices to become proficient.  The proof, as they say, is in the print",1

Falwell's unfortunate comments about the tragedy of Sept. 11, 2001, I recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand, ""Why would that guy say that stuff?"" Harding presents an objective, intelligent, perceptive analysis of the way that Fundamentalist language shapes the way in which they relate to the world, and how Jerry Falwell changed that shaping from withdrawal to the active Moral Majority of the 1980s. Harding combs through Falwell's history and sermons to observe how the language of ""being born again"" affects the listener, showing Falwell's shift from separatism to political activism. She critiques both Falwell and Falwell's critics in a fair and keenly insightful way. Good reading and good understanding",1

I was shy and didn't want to bother him, so I didn't introduce myself and have a chat. I would have loved to have spoken with him. Now I regret my shyness - should've taken the chance. Yazoo City has an enduring quality and charm that shows in all his books and stories. No matter where I live, it will always be home. There is a great feeling of safety and warmth whenever I drive into the city limits. It is a feeling of home. Not many people have that sense of home these days.

"221","Excellent historical fiction","I love historical fiction, and The March was one of the better historical novels that I've read. The characters are well-drawn, and the action moves along briskly, with no dead spots.  The civil war background seemed very authentic, and unlike many similar historical novels that focus on the military actions or the civilian actions, The March blends the two to show that war really is hell.Doctorow is an excellent writer, and he obviously did a lot of period research to make the background so believable.  My only objection was his implication that the civil war was only about slavery and that Union soldiers fought solely because of the slavery issue.  That's not true, as studies of Union soldiers' letters and diaries have demonstrated that most soldiers fought out of patriotism or to join with other family members, or for other reasons than just slavery.  That also applies to Confederate soldiers.  A minor quibble that doesn't really hurt the book, but it does discredit the author for not sticking to real, documented historical fact.Highly recommended",1
"471","My favourite poetry book :)","We got this book out from our library recently and within a week I had ordered a copy for us.  My nearly 2 year old demands poems from it all the time (as only 2 year olds can demand!!) and her older brothers have also enjoyed them.  The book has so many poems that struck a chord with us; just one small example: With recent cold weather I ended up sharing Dragon Smoke (about day being so cold you can see your own breath) with my oldest son's class at school. I have also suggested that our local pre-school buys a copy for the adult library so that the poems can be shared with the children when relevant themes / moments arise.  The pictures are perfect for the poems creating a completely wonderful package. It is just an absolutely superb book and one I will be buying as a present for many other families.  I think in a way the title is a bit of a pity, (although completly reasonable), as these poems will last a lot longer than just for the ""very Young""",1
"770"," A rare gem (spirituality)","As a ""follower of Christ"" (Christian) who considers himself an Evangelical Protestant, this little devotional book will hold a special place in my library and my heart.  For all Christian believers, the richness and power of Brother Lawrence's life's witness and words are a fountain of Truth, a treasure that is as elegant (spiritually) as it is simple.  For the non-believers, I am afraid that reading this booklet (a spiritual treasure in disguise) will just confirm St. Paul the Apostles's words that ""the message of the cross is ... foolishness to the Gentiles"" (1 Corinthians. 1:18, 23 and 2:14).The only way to do justice to this booklet is to quote from it and let you get a taste of it ...This is a unique biography because it is not compiled by the Brother Lawrence of the Resurrection (birth name Nicholas Herman but known by his monastic name) but by the ones around his life in 17th century France.  Thus one learns very little about the beginnings of his life but very much about his godly lifestyle in the last 30 years of life of bliss (presence of God in his heart) and suffering (3 physical and debilitating ailments). We learn about this Spirit-filled vessel in God's vineyard - Brother Lawrence, by reading the Eulogy of the abbot of Lawrence's Christian community, 4 short notes of his conversations with his spiritual father - Abb? de Beaufort, 16 very short letters of spiritual advice and encouragement Brother Lawrence wrote to friends and seekers, a manuscript found at his death called ""Spiritual Maxims"" and a memoir of a leader in the church in France.The followings are a selection of the many highlights and underlined phrases and sentences from this book:""Busy yourself with keeping your mind in the presence of the Lord.""""My most normal habit is to simply keep my attention on God, and to be generally and lovingly aware of Him.""""I occupy myself solely with keeping my attention on God and by being generally and lovingly aware of Him.""""We have an infinitely good God who knows what we need.""""Console yourself with the One who keeps you fastened to the cross.""""We should love our friends, but without prejudicing the love of God which must be first.""""Think often about Him; worship Him without ceasing.  Life and die with Him.  This is the beautiful call in the life of a Christian.""""...we should love one another through our words of counsel and even more through our good examples.""""...our only business in this life is to please God. ... my little progress in the path of perfection.""""I applied myself to practicing the presence of God ... Doing this gave me such a high esteem for God that faith alone was capable of satisfying me.""""A devout woman told me that the spiritual life is a life of grace that begins with service fear, increases through the hope of eternal life, and is consumated by pure love.""MY PRAYER: May we all experience God's love, which truly can consume all other passions, and be filled with His grace which will empower us to truly love our neighbors (Christian and non-Christian) as ourselves.  This is my life goal ",1
"6","A good book.","Since I am a World's Fair ""fanatic"" I have read almost everything that I can on the subject. In general, this is an interesting and well researched book. The author has apparently attended most of the expositions that he writes about. However, I must point up three rather glaring errors in the book. In describing the Louisiana World Expo of 1984 he states that the unbuilt symbol tower was supposed to be ""80 feet tall,just 150 feet shorter than the Eiffel Tower."" Since the Eiffel Tower is actually over 900 feet tall,the New Orleans fair tower would have had to have been at least 800 feet tall.This may have been a typo which the author did not catch in time.The other error states that the US Pavilion at the Brussels World's Fair of 1958 was a ""large,squat,round concrete block structure."" It was indeed large and round, but not squat and not made of concrete blocks.According to the excellent book about Edward Durrell Stone, the architect of the pavilion,the outer walls consisted of large aluminum panels which were latticed in intricate designs so that the interior would be flooded with natural light. I have seen photos of the US Pavilion, and it seems a beautiful and airy structure to me. (In comparison to the Soviet Pavilion, which resembled a large refrigerator!) Thirdly, the Spokane Expo of 1974 was not the first time that the U.S.S.R. exhibited at a U.S. expo. They had a large pavilion at the New York World's Fair of 1939. All in all, however, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of World's Fairs",1
"182","The Best of the Trilogy","     Red Lily is clearly the best book in the series.  While reading this one I could visualize the scenes.  This book would make a good movie, but I can't decide under what category it would fit into.  Although it's clearly a romance portions of the book would definitely be considered a thriller.  With all the talk of a ghost (as the rest of the series) this book it isn't a believable read as much as a fun read.     ",1

"349","Vernes' Vision of a Subterranean World","A Jules Vernes classic, this is one of those novels that has stood up well against the test of time.  True, there are some items that may seem a bit dated, and of course the whole scenario of the fantastic adventure to the depths of the earth is impossible.  Yet, this novel is still a joy to read.With a stoic Icelander as their guide, a renowned professor and his reluctant and skeptical nephew descend into the depths of a volcano in the vast frozen tundra of the Arctic, as the adventurers attempt to retrace the steps of a renowned alchemist.  Contrary to popular belief (and scientific reality), the party descends deeper into the bowels of the earth, which is remarkably of a mild climate and not a boiling inferno.  I won't serve as spoiler, but sufficed to say, that they uncover vast new worlds and creatures living in the subterranean world hundreds of miles beneath the terrestrial crust of the earth.Vernes does attempt to make their descent seem plausible from a scientific standpoint.  Their instruments, a crude electric light and others, would be considered state-of-the art for their time.  Vernes also goes in great detail to describe the geological formations and fossilized remains contained in the earth.  Vernes also attempts to explain how it is possible to travel so far under the surface of the earth without increased pressure harming the body.  And if you take Verne's theories to heart (although modern science refutes them), their journey is plausible.However, I do have a couple minor gripes.  Vernes goes into great detail describing fossils and rock formations, which no doubt lend scientific credence to his novel.  Although this may interst a geologist or paleontologist, the rest of the masses (myself included) probably find this too tedious and distracting from the main story line.  Also, there is one glaring scientific discrepancy with Vernes logic. During their rapid ascent (the details I won't reveal), the adventurers would have surely perished from decompression sickness (a.k.a., ""the bends"").  Although it was still a new phenomena at the time, I believe Vernes should have taken into account the rapid change in pressure, as he did during their slow descent into the abyss.The nitpicking aside, this is a superb novel that has withstood the test of time.  A modern reader will no doubt be entertained and enthralled at Verne's vision of a subterranean world.  Nearly a century and a half later, Vernes' works still inspire awe and imagination",1

"412","Splendid but flawed biography","Not only a terrific portrait of Louis B. Mayer, but a wonderful history of Hollywood movie-making.  My caveat is the portrait of Dore Schary.  While Eyman is fair in his depiction of the struggle between Mayer and Thalberg, Eyman found it necessary to choose sides in the Mayer Schary conflict in the last part of the book, possibly to ""correct"" the view of Mayer the Monster and Schary the savior in earlier Mayer bios.  His portrait of Schary, a man I knew, bears no resemblance to that decent, fair minded, and gifted man.  It is clear that he interviewed few surviving friends and family members of Schary.  Eyman claims that Schary had no knowledge of the making of musicals, yet Schary in his post MGM days produced a successful musical, ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown.""  Whatever good flims came from MGM during Schary's reign are dismissed as the work of others. He creates a portrait of Schary as a talentless hack, forgetting not only the good films Schary wrote in earlier days but the successful Broadway play he wrote about FDR, ""Sunrise at Campabello.""  He writes that Schary only spoke of himself in retirement.  I knew few older men who took such an interst in world affairs and the fortunes and misfortunes of his friends.  If he can get Schary so wrong, it forces me to question his other judgments.  Having said all that, I think this is a fine book, evoking old Hollywood with grace and style.   ",1
"889","Good for the most part","I'm a fan of Bill Myers work and have been since ""Blood of Heaven"". This one slipped by me somehow and when I saw it I immediately got it. While the plot is somewhat tight for the most part, I do have some problems with parts of it. For one thing, the thought of a terrorist who will kill someone very close to him (read the book to find out) shouldn't have any qualms about killing millions of others. So why is he so intent on the stones? But the most annoying part of the book is the fact that people call each other by their names so much that it gets old. The minute anything happens, they're all screaming each other's names in the midst of the chaos until you finally just want them to shut up and get on with it. For the first-time emergency, we can live with it...but when something happens every few chapters, you've got to have a break! ""Daniel!"" ""Tyler!"" ""Helen!"" ""Tyler!"" ""Daniel!"" ""Dad!"" ""Helen!"" ""Tyler!"" Give me a break! Otherwise, a good story...though not up to the same level as ""Threshold"" or ""Blood of Heaven"" (definitely better than ""Eli"" though). Recommended",1
"740","Funny and True","After seeing the movie, I decided to pick up the book.  This book proved to be very funny, as the protagonist wrestles with issues that many, many women her age face today.  Fielding ingeniously draws readers in with very true, often serious real-life topics (being single and not liking it, infidelity, betrayal)and is yet able turn it into light, funny reading.  That takes talent, in my book.  In the wrong hands, this novel could have been a very dreary book that no one would want to read(in light of the above topics).

"249","The Elements of Style: A Classic with Timeless Advice","Although the original Elements of Style was written in 1919 (or earlier), it still holds true that anyone who wants to learn how to write in a clear and concise manner will benefit from this book.

One of the most important things that the writer stands to gain from this book is an improvement in his writing style. After reading this book, you will know how to write in a way that comes naturally, write with nouns and pronouns (not superfluous adverbs and adjectives), write and then rewrite, but do not overwrite and overstate, use orthodox spelling, do not explain too much, avoid fancy words, be clear, do not inject opinions, use figures of speech sparingly, and countless other helpful techniques.

"917","Great book","This book is the best book on Rand's esthetics I've ever read; in fact, it is the only book on the topic that I know of.  It is refreshing to see that the authors are objective and critical; they are not slavish cultists  savoring every last word written by Rand.  They approach the material with  critical distance and do an excellent job of placing Rand's work in the  larger history of esthetic theory.  They demolish abstract art, and devote  considerable energy to discussing Rand's definition of art.  They even  propose their own individual alternatives!   If anything shows  independence, it is this willingness to debate the differences between the  authors of the same work!  Remarkable!  The world of Rand commentary is  filled to the brim with sectarianism and partisanship.  That is clear just  by reading one of the reviews here, by people who are devotees of certain  ""scholars"" who do nothing but repeat the catechism.  They take  swipes at genuinely independent work anytime it is published; that is why  they hate this book.  Because it is independent-minded.  Judge for  yourself.  Don't be fooled",1

I read half of it, then moved from Seattle to Valdez, Alaska.  All the while I was moving, I could not stop thinking about this book.  As soon as my shipment arrived, I found the book ASAP and finished it.  I have seen that some complain about the resistance products he promotes in his books.  I look at it this way:  Spend a ton of money on a gym membership or spend around $10.00 for a resistance rope - PLUS - you get to do this in the privacy of your home.  This is a great idea, especially for women that have children, a job and the home to contend with.  Jim Karas was overweight for several years.  He can relate to me.  He revels on the fact that resistance training is the way to go and thank goodness because I simply cannot handle cardio workouts due to a bad back.

I read this book in college when I was going through a little bit of a rough patch, figuring out what I wanted, etc.  Now that I've graduated and am slowly becoming wary of the corporate world, I need more positivity in my life so I'm re-reading it in the hopes that I can zero in on my goals and start achieving them again.  I highly recommend it to those who are open-minded enough to give it a chance",1
"223","Fun non stop action!","The Pelican Brief is one of John Grisham's more fast paced and exciting book. Two supreme court justices are murdered by someone who does such a good job that there are few if any clues to go on. Darby Shaw and her lover/professor are intrigued by who could have done this so Darby does a ton of research and writes the ""Pelican Brief"". Her boyfriend/professor is a good friend of someone in the FBI and the file gets distributed. The bad guys find out about Darby, who apparently has hit the suspects right on and the chase begins. This book is very entertaining with nonstop action. You'll be constantly turning the page to see how Darby and friends etc keep escaping and how the plot will unfold. The only problems with the book are as follows: 1 - The book has so many characters that it gets confusing at times2 - The book is all action and adventure and little else. Once it's done you'll never go back and read it again. This would make a very poor book club book.3 - A little over the top on the implied sex etc between Darby and her professor etc... (but nothing compared to what you'll get in other books)Overall a very entertaing and exciting book but not a lot of ""soul"". I would definitely recomend it to anyone who likes action books. ",1
"745","Irresistible Grace","I first saw this book reviewed in the early 1990's. It aroused a double response of curiosity and suspicion. Like many a cynic I asked myself, ""Now who's this guy and what's he spinning?"" Against my natural inclination to dismiss it, I ordered POG. On receiving it I began reading and found my suspicions confirmed: here was another triumphal and insensitive adherent to the doctrine of the sovereignty of God.Strangely, however, I couldn't stop reading. Despite months of scrawling angry counter-arguments in the margins of its pages I was drawn inexplicably to the sensibility of its core premise about God's delight in being God. To make this story short, I found myself, in the end, exhausted but surrendered to the portrait of God that Piper paints with the full palette of scriptural truth. And finally happy too, with the beginnings of the joy Piper wished for his sons in the Foreword.Salvation history testifies to the fact that a distinguishing evidence of the truth is that it is often hated - at first. The fact that POG eventually had such an unnatural (or supernatural) effect on someone like me - initially so inclined to resist and rebuff - speaks more to the validity of this book than if I had joined immediately in the chorus of deserved admiration.This is not a critical analysis of POG; others have provided that sufficiently on this page. Instead it's a personal account of the Irresistible Grace that against all nature drew a small and scoffing soul into undeserved open spaces where God's glory was seen...and is now sung.",1
"243","Great stuff for the science-minded cook","Fascinating exploration into the physics of cooking, written in an engaging and detailed style. Probably better for the scientist who cooks than for the cook who's into science, since the language is sometimes a little dense for the layperson. Worth working through, though, if only for the gorgeous and elegant formula for figuring out how long to boil your eggs to get them EXACTLY right.One caveat: the author is British, and recipes, measurements, and terms are geared for the British/European cook. This means you'll find a complete explanation of sausage rolls and nothing about popcorn. Just FYI",1
"925","A Reassuring Read","What I like about this book is that the tone is just right for a self-conscious preteen boy who has more questions than answers but is too embarrassed to ask anybody. Leave this book in his room or in the bathroom without making a big deal of it, and I bet he'll take a look inside. Some books are so clinical; others don't provide enough information. This one gets it right--at least for your basic seventh or eighth grader. As someone who has been writing for girls for years, I'm always curious about what is out there for boys, and I like Daldry's style.Carol Weston, author of Girltalk: All the Stuff Your Sister Never Told You",1
"710","Wow, this book made all the difference.","I can't say enough about this wonderful book. It's packed full of examples, covers more than just the pre-adoption and placement aspects, and is incredibly non-judgemental. There's so much information here, more than I expected. It really helped me think through all of the issues related to adoption. It's for both birth and adoptive parents, in fact, two of the birth parents we've been in contact with were excited to hear about it and ended up ordering the book themselves. Reading through this book really helped me conquer my fears about adoption. I'm so glad it was recommended to us. If you're thinking about adoption, even if you're thinking that open adoption isn't right for you I highly recommend taking a chance and buying this book. It's great",1
"918","This book tells girls what good sportsmanship is all about.","""Good Sports"" is a book which helps girls to be the ""best athlete you can be."" It catagorizes players, parents, and other important people into real-life situations. It has quizes, quotes from  other athletes, and memory pages. Also, it offers a lot of web sites and  other addresses for girls to look up their favorite sports. More  importantly, this book shows girls what teamwork and good sportsmanship is  all about. One of my favorite parts in the book says: ""Sometimes heart  is the strongest muscle."" This book also tells girls how to take good  care of yourself- to eat healthy so that you are a better athlete. It  includes the food pyramid and what one serving is. ""Good Sports""  involves ""Power Drills"" and advice from other girls. It goes  inside the lives of other athletes, such as Michelle Kwan, but also shows  girls'lives who are teens or pre-teens.  This book not only focuses on the  physical parts of playing a game, but on the mental part as well: keeping  your dreams alive even when you're at the bottom of the team, or you were  embarrassed at a basketball game when you tripped. I would reccommend  ""Good Sports"" to any female athelete, whether you are experienced  or haven't even started yet. It teaches you the basics and also the mental  parts of a game! It has advice on keeping your mind and body strong, along  with being a good winner and loser. It has advice from other athletes,  famous or otherwise, memory pages to record your victories, dreams and  goals, and ways to reach sports associations. As the book says, it includes  ""Winning. Losing. And everything in between.&quot",1
"205","Scarier than any Stephen King novel...","You want to read a horror story? This is it. This is the shameful way our government dealt with AIDS in the first six years it appeared in the country- by doing nothing at all.EVERYONE ignored it. The CDC, the NIH, the National Cancer Institute, it was ignored by everyone but a handful of scientists and doctors, and they were ignored too. Over 2000 gay men (and hemophiliacs, and straight people, and babies) died before the government even acknowleged that yes, something new was going around. Newspapers and media did not report this, because it was too embarrassing talking about how it was a ""gay disease."" Gay men didn't want to discuss that it ""might"" be spread through sex, and the ideas of shutting down the bathhouses and losing that little bit of hard-won liberation was unthinkable. Blood banks wouldn't even ACKNOWLEGE the fact that their products were contaminated, even after it was PROVEN that transfusion AIDS was possible and happening.By the time President Reagan FIRST uttered the word AIDS, over 25,000 Americans were dead from the disease.This book made me cry. The entire way through it, I wanted to scream, I wanted to throw things, I wanted to hit people until they realized that gay people deserve to live too. A university official that was denying AIDS researchers desperately needed funding had the nerve to actually remark, ""Well, at least AIDS is getting rid of a lot of undesirable people."" How absolutely disgusting. This is a dauntingly large book- 621 pages of reading, all of it frustrating, angering, scream-inducing, and yet, still inspiring. They didn't give up. No one threw in the towel until their last breath, or until funding, sufficient funding, was finally granted. Sadly, the author himself died of AIDS in 1994. God bless everyone who worked so hard to make AIDS a household word, which finally happened, oh, about SEVEN STINKING YEARS after it first started killing people in the US. What the heck is wrong with this country? Why did people have their heads in the sand for so long? What's so stinking WRONG with us?Another book everyone should read, if only to know how our government helped spread AIDS around the world by ignoring it for six damn years. How many people did they kill by doing that? Far, far too many. We were the last civilized nation to institute an AIDS education/prevention program. This book made me dislike the bureaucracy of this country even more, and I didn't think that was possible.God bless everyone who is working to make life better for people with AIDS",1

"560","5000 yrs of Western Civilization Mapped Out","I am an inveterate map reader. Whenever I travel there is a map in my pocket. But a recent trip to the Middle East and growing hobby collecting ancient coins had left me lost and confused as I tried to put in context  the ruins visited and the coins I collected. With time, the names of cities  and regions change so that one needs a separate map for each period.   Morkot's superbly written historical atlas not only provides maps, but the  rationale and context for their evolution and change. One of the best  features in the structure of this book is the use of the overview, followed  by a series of in-depth accounts, each from the perspective of the  important ""players"" during a given historical period.  This  approach is immensely effective in reinforcing the information since the  same information is repeated and new information added as each of the  regions, their politics and battles, are succesively presented.  From the  Mycenae to the Parthians are thousands of years, thousands of miles, and  thousands of political entities whose ebb and flow of power and reach of  influence affect us even today. For the first time after years of puzzling  over strange Grecian place names and leaders, I am now able to begin to  understand the who what when and where for the 5 millenia preceding the  birth of Christ.

"312","Min Cui's Review","Narrated through the heartfelt voice of Amy Tan, the Kitchen God's Wife illustrates a compelling story of heritage and self-discovery. As a young Chinese woman, Winnie Louie, the main character and the conduit through which Tan expresses her voice, must endure an atrocious life under the abuse and torture of her wicked husband Wen Fu, a pretentious, arrogant, and egregious man who not only cheated his way up the military ladder, but also committed numerous felons including rape, murder, blackmailing, and extortion. Day after day, beating after beating, Winnie slowly begins to realize that in order to escape from Wen Fu and start a new life free from violence and marked by love, radical and immediate actions must be taken. When dealing with someone without even a modicum of human decency, someone like Wen Fu, the usual, traditional, and orthodox actions are futile. Striking a perfect chord between concision and elaboration, Tan keeps the reader constantly engaged as the dramatic story of Winnie unfolds itself. Relying mostly on authentic voice and keeping the meretricious elements to a minimum, Tan narrates the novel with surprising precision and unmatched beauty. Against the magnificent backdrops of a WWII-era China, the novel reassures the universal nature of mankind, that the problems troubling people today are experienced by all generations, regardless of race, nationality, or social status. As you read this rare gem amount literature, open the introspective window and enjoy the novel with your heart.",1

"573","Necessary Illusions: Chomsky's tour de force","Of all the articles and books of Chomsky that I have read, Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies is without doubt the most exhaustively researched (and footnoted), the most logically  structured, and the most convincing. Chomsky reminds us that the majority  of the populace rely on the various media institutions for their  information about political affairs; both domestic and foreign. One can  only hold an opinion on a topic if one knows about the topic. So take, for  example, the popular myth of the 'persistent Soviet vetoe' at the UN during  the cold war. Why do people believe the USSR was constantly vetoeing any  and every Security Council Resolution? Simple! When they did, it generated  front page condemnation. When the US or the UK exercised their right of  veteo: silence. As Chomsky notes, during the years of 1970 and 1989 the  former Soviet Union veteod 8 resolutions. The US veteod some 56. This is  what Chomsky refers to as Thought Control. Unless the public examine the  factual record of the UN themselves, they will never come by this  information, (at least not in the mainstream press). So although Chomsky's  title may appear somewhat paradoxical, or oxymoronic, a moments reflection  on such facts shows it to be, in fact, extremenly pragmatic and truthful.  The question is, have you the honesty and sheer guts to question yourself  and challenge the information which has contributed to your beliefs?  The  crux of Chomsky's argument is that propaganda is to a democracy what  violence is to a dictatorship. Chomsky points out that, in fact, propaganda  is, contrary to popular postulations, more important and vital to a  democratic society because people still have some rights. That is, since  people can talk, the powers that be must ensure that only the correct words  come out of the peoples' mouths. In a dictatorship it does not really  matter too much what people think; for whatever they may think, they have  to do what they are told, by pain of death. In countries such as the US  (and the UK) other, more subtle, methods are required.  People often  critisise Chomsky for the sources of his information (the copious  footnotes). No such critique can be levelled at this work. Chomsky's  sources are declassified internal planning documents, naval proceedings  documents, and the very institutions he examines, New York Times,  Washington Post etc. If there was one Chomsky book I would suggest you to  read, this would be it",1

"971","A Solid Defense","The Gospel of Judas has had its fifteen minutes of fame. It is but another in an endlessly long line of stories or documents meant to shake the foundations of the Christian faith. Like its many predecessors, it gave National Geographic and anti-Christian authors an opportunity to voice their dissension with the biblical story of Jesus. A book titled The Gospel of Judas shot to near the top of the bestsellers lists and nearly as quickly, shot straight back down. Still, while its popularity was short-lived, it allowed Bart Ehrman and other revisionists a chance to laud the epistle for its new insights into the life of Christ. Surely Ehrman forever cast doubt upon his credibility as a historian when he blathered, ""(The Gospel of Judas) is one of the greatest historical discoveries of the twentieth century. It rivals the finding of the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Gnostic Gospels of Nag Hammadi.""National Geographic describes the importance of the document in this way: ""The Gospel of Judas gives a different view of the relationship between Jesus and Judas, offering new insights into the disciple who betrayed Jesus. Unlike the accounts in the canonical Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, in which Judas is portrayed as a reviled traitor, this newly discovered Gospel portrays Judas as acting at Jesus' request when he hands Jesus over to the authorities."" A classically dualistic, gnostic document, The Gospel of Judas presents a Jesus who is seeking to escape from the corruption of this physical world and asks Judas to betray Him so He can be free of this wickedness. Judas complies and shows himself to be a hero, rather than a villain. No longer the betrayer, He is a faithful friend to Jesus Christ.Renowned New Testament scholar N.T. Wright is the first Christian to my knowledge to write a thorough refutation of the teachings of The Gospel of Judas. Judas and the Gospel of Jesus is due for publication in October of 2006 and will be published by Baker Books. It is a short book, weighing in at only 144 pages, but provides a thorough treatment of the subject matter.Wright is fair to this newly published document. He does not say that there is no value in The Gospel of Judas for surely there is, for it tells us much about the gnosticism that was a great opponent of early Christianity. It gives historians access to an authentic, original document. But it tells us nothing about the real Jesus and the real Judas. Those who would have us believe that this letter provides details about the real life of the real Jesus can be little more than revisionists. Wright shows that such people believe in what he calls ""the new myth of Christian origins."" This myth, popularized by men such as Bart Ehrman, has three main teachings: first, Jesus was not as the canonical gospels portray Him; second, there were a great many different varieties of early Christianity, and they produced a large number of different ""gospels,"" all of which circulated among Christians more or less unchecked; third, when Christianity became consolidated in the fourth century, many teachings about the ""true"" Christian faith were rejected.""Classic Christianity,"" he says, ""has a lot more life and promise than have ever been imagined by those who propose the new Myth, or by those who offer newly discovered gnostic texts as the panacea for our ills. It is a shame that the churches have been so muzzled, so often self-blinded to the full dimensions of the gospel they profess, the gospel of Jesus himself.""Through this short book, Wright asks good questions and insightfully shows where The Gospel of Judas simply cannot be held as equal in any way to Scripture. He shows himself to be a New Testament scholar the equal of any involved in promoting this new gospel. While the document appears to be genuine, it is little different and little more significant than the multitudes of other gnostic writings which have come down to us, even two millenia later.It is perhaps somewhat ironic that N.T. Wright, who has reimagined and reinvented many of the teachings of Paul (and thus Jesus), would be the first to make a stand for the truth against others who would seek to reinvent Jesus. Unfortunately, Wright's New Perspectives are glimpsed, even if only dimly, through much of the text of this book. Still, he offers a compelling response to Ehrman and others and one well worth reading. I would tend to believe that, for most people, The Gospel of Judas is best ignored. It offers little that would be of interest to the average person. For those who do have interest in it, Judas and the Gospel of Jesus will no doubt prove an interesting response to the irrational views espoused by those who wish to reinvent Christianity and to cast doubt upon Scripture",1
"139","Though-provoking treatise on human dependence on dogs","In the ""New Work of Dogs,""author Jon Katz expands his scope from focusing on his relationship with his dogs---a topic he has detailed in previous books---to examining the canine-human relationship on a broader scale.Informed by arduous research (a two foot stack of papers, books, journals), he sets out and succeeds in making a case that dogs, by-and-large, are doing different work from their traditional herding, hunting, and guarding. We have pushed our canines into new territory as emotional companions, therapy dogs, even extensions of our egos to help us cope with an increasingly complex world. The notion that we are growing increasingly isolated as a culture is not new, but seeing how humans are using dogs to cope with a society that no longer maintains the cultural bearings of ""the greatest generation"" is new (at least to me).Mr. Katz visits with many dogs and their owners of various social economic strata who inhabit the enclaves of Montclair, New Jersey.  More often than not, he found that dogs are being used as emotional surrogate, a classic situation noted in attachment theory but hitherto mostly applied to other people. Many of these dogs are pampered, untrained, and confused. Others are abused to some extent, whether through deliberate actions or through negligence. The stories are alarming and informing. I see many of the mistakes I made with previous dogs laid out before me and wonder if my two Australian shepherds are as well-adjusted as they seem. Many reviewers have commented, and correctly, that anyone planning to own a dog needs to read this book. Sadly, I think Mr. Katz will largely reach those people who already possess a great deal of knowledge about dogs---those who train their dogs, who buy or adopt breeds suitable for their living conditions or schedules, and who treat their dogs with consistent, loving authority.Mr. Katz does not make harsh judgments on any of the circumstances he depicts but instead concludes by noting how many dogs are dumped in shelters where they languish or die. The numbers are staggering. And he takes matters a step further with the thought-provoking idea that if we have dog rescue groups, how can we not also have their counterparts to reach out to those of our own species in dire need.

"733","Creating a Census for an Antique Book","This book is rather different. Although it's about Copernicus' book ""De Revolutionibus"", very little astronomy is discussed. There is also very little about Copernicus himself. The main theme of the book is finding as many still-existing copies of Copernicus' book as possible, and describing each one in detail - the ultimate purpose being the publication of a so-called ""census"" of that ancient book, i.e., a snapshot in time that identifies and describes each individual copy and where it is located in the world. Since I know nothing about antique book collecting, I learned a lot on this field by reading this book. I was not aware of all the work and travel required in finding a given copy of a book, especially identifying the authors of any hand-written notes on its pages. I did find certain lengthy descriptions rather monotonous, but some of the author's adventures are quite intriguing, particularly where he makes use of his notes to identify possibly stolen copies that eventually surface at auctions or elsewhere. Some aspects of life and technology in the sixteenth century that are important for the theme of this book, as well as discussions of some of Copernicus' contemporaries, are touched upon. But as the author states, this book is really a memoir of his census project. I think that this book would be of most interest to those with a passion for ancient books and ancient book collecting.",1

Its text stresses that children are the same the world over.  They have the same feelings and needs, and have the same hopes and dreams.  The illustrations are a nice change from the usual.  Each page is surrounded by a gold picture frame in which faux jewels are embedded.  The illustrations appear to be tempera or opaque watercolor, drawn in Persian style.  The colors are very saturated.  The book's cover gives you an idea of what they look like.  The message of this book is one of diversity--that even though children live in different parts of the world and may have different nationalities, races, ethnicities, languages or faiths, they still have the same hopes, dreams and daily needs.  This is a very important message for children to hear in today's world where there is so much suspicion of those we ""perceive"" to be different.  The more children realize that kids are the same everywhere, the more tolerant they will be.  Children pick up prejudice by the time they are three years of age, say researchers, so you have to nip it in the bud very early, and this book does that in a wonderful way. ",1
"735","Critical Book Review","         Diane Ravitch discusses the development of censorship in textbooks and on tests that has been slowly integrated into the educational system.  She speaks about the rights of the First Amendment pertaining to free speech, and provides a detailed history of how censorship has become a part of the textbooks and tests that have been developed.  The book is informative and thought- provoking.	Ravitch starts by discussing the creation of bias and sensitivity boards and how they have come to dominate what can and cannot be said in certain literature for education.  She goes on to talk about certain topics and words that must not be used.  This list is ridiculous and completely irrational.  Due to left and right wing intervention, almost everything of interest has been stripped from the educational requirements.  Ravitch discusses in great detail the effort of both sides and what their motives were in demanding that certain changes be made in textbooks and tests.  She goes further to detail the goals of each side and how they were met.  She argues that such censorship keeps children from learning historically accurate facts because adults would rather paint a picture of Utopia and keep children from feeling any emotions.  	Ravitch presents a good, convincing argument with concrete reasoning to support her views.  To the best of my knowledge and research, she has done a great job at gathering accurate information about what has been going on in publishing companies and the struggles they have faced from bias and sensitivity reviews, feminists, minorities, and other groups.  Her reasoning is inductively strong with few logical fallacies.  Occasionally, Ravitch begs the question through circular reasoning and attacks the motives of some publishing companies.  Although she has clear concise points, Ravitch intermittently distorts the timeline within chapters, which is slightly confusing.  Her claims are logically consistent and her argument seems complete with all the relevant evidence presented.  Throughout research, Ravitch manages to also find publishing companies who have tried to change standards and incorporate more accurate facts in textbooks and what happens to these companies when they go against the bias and sensitivity rules.  The argument Ravitch presents is a historically accurate account of censorship in textbooks, fairly and effectively arguing her point.  	Today, more and more people are beginning to notice what is going on with censorship in textbooks and are speaking up and taking steps toward removing these censors.  Textbooks are becoming more accurate, and classic literature reintroduced to the classroom.  Ravitch calls for the dispersion of the ""language police"" and a return to the ""freedom of speech"" that everyone has the right to exercise.  ",1

From the first page I began to re-live the entire bonding rituals that we had experienced over that weekend.  How to connect, how to communicate, and how to intimately bond on a higher plane!  Although some of the prose is repetitive, it helps instill a spiritual base on which the reader can pull from. A definite ""must have"" book for the gay tribe who would like to interact spiritually and emotionally",1
"648","As informative and Entertaining as the Movie Counterpart","I purchased this book after having seen Super Size Me and I was a little worried that there would be nothing new for Morgan to present. I, however, was proven wrong. This is a very good read that is able to put down more statistics and specifics about the food industry that the movie was not as focuses on. The movie, of course, was focused mostly on the fast food industry.Morgan Spurlock is always a surprise. You seem him with his long sideburns and know he is from West Virginia and you just expect the stereotype. He is not a stereotype. The book is written in a very clear voice, the same intelligent humorous voice that came across in the movie, ""Super Size Me.""My one disappointment is that I was hoping the book would have more details about the diet that his girlfriend put him on when he finished his 30 days, but now I see she has her own book. Ah, marketing!I think you can read this as stand alone but as everyone notes, it works great in conjunctions with the movie to help you not forget",1
"466","The Birth of Modern Geology","Part geology, part biography, part history of Scotland, this excellent book is a tribute to James Hutton, the originator of modern geology. Starting with the status of geology in the eighteenth century and the use of the Bible as the basis for estimating the age of the earth, the author weaves the intriguing story of James Hutton and how he came about discovering signs of the earth's true antiquity. The political situation in eighteenth century Scotland is well described and illustrates the times in which Hutton lived. But the book goes further in that the evolution of geology after Hutton's death is also discussed, ending with modern estimates of the age of the earth and a brief description of the methods used to produce them. This is a very well-written and exciting book that should appeal to a wide audience",1
"651","bright and enjoyable, but not especially deep","While I agree with several people who don't consider this chick-lit, I don't see why that is a bad thing. I enjoyed Radish's writing style, purple prose and all. If you're expecting a Dickensian journey into a complex character, this book is not it. However, it does provide a snapshot of a woman forced to assess her life and choose between the road less traveled and her current miserable life. Yes, the (positive and negative) circumstances of Meg's life were unrealistic, but I felt they were dramatized to make a point. We all have strong, kind, and amazing people in our lives, but we have to look for these things in people. I had an aunt just like Marcia, who fought her battles with a fantastic sense of humor, courage, and love for everyone around her. The message I took from this book is this - life can be all you want if you simply take the time to nourish your own strength and that of those around you. It doesn't take money to be powerful and satisfied with your life",1
"678","Excellent book","I took the 2 Tom Cover's classes in Information Theory at Stanford last year. We used this book as the text for both classes. The first class covered roughly the first 8 chapters and the second class the remaining ones. This book assumes that the reader has a clear understanding of basic probability theory.Tom's classes were among the most enjoyable I took last year and I recommend this text to anyone interested in knowing about Information Theory. If you just want to know the basics, read through chapters 1-8. The reader interested in understanding the power of information theory is adviced to read the whole book. A final comment, it is clear to me after my experience with Tom's classes that mastering Information Theory is a daunting task. And in fact, this book provides the interested researcher just with the basic knowledge needed to enter the field",1

Keen to dodge a storm, we did a 48 hour dash down to the safety of Yepoon running a 3 hours on/3 hours off watch cycle. Problem was I didnt get any sleep. I was too deep inside Six Frigates. Back on deck, I'd update my watch on what I'd just read. They loved it. Sailing by instalments.Ian Toll's a wonderful writer. The man is a time machine. He drops you right into the middle of the smoke-filled, blood splattered action. Patrick O'Brian fans: this is the book for you. Toll's also a deft hand at dropping insights that get you thinking. Like the half-parargraph mention of Madison writing to Thomas Jefferson agreeing that a war with the arab states of north africa could easily be won, and in the process stop the attacks on US merchant ships but advises Jefferson that the issue will be the cost of then keeping the peace... Perhaps George W should have a read a little more history at college.You'll taste the sweat and blood and salt on every page. Best read I've had in ages.

"555","A Writer Worth Watching","Imaginary playmates are not unusual. But, there hasn't been a playmate like TillyTilly since those nasties Henry James created in ""Turn of the Screw.""And, like them, TillyTilly seems to be something more than what a child has imagined.Jessamy Harrison, the eight-year-old daughter of a Nigerian mother and a British father, is a precocious and lonely child subject to screaming tantrums and panic attacks. During a visit to her Nigerian relatives, Jess explores an abandoned building and meets TillyTilly, a child of her own age, who she befriends. The problem is, no one else can see TillyTilly.On their return to England, TillyTilly mysteriously shows up and soon leads Jess into a heap of trouble. Fun becomes horror as Tilly demonstrates a penchant for cruelty.Given that Miss Oyeyemi was only 18 when she penned this complex novel, there are some drawbacks. Jess is often portrayed as much more sophisticated and articulate than the reader can believe and some characters are not drawn out enough. Despite these flaws, maturity is certain to give us a writer well worth watching for in the future.

It's Seder Time! etc.) Tod Cohen's full-color photos capture the joyousness of the children as they learn to celebrate the holiday wearing new clothes, making Jewish New Year's cards for their families, tasting new foods such as pomegranates and star fruits, and blowing the shofar. The sounds of the shofar are explained in easy, understandable terms for this young age level. The children are also shown learning such things as tying their shoes and writing their names.  The brief amount of text on each page and very appealing children pictured learning to make round challot and blow the shofar make this just right for using with pre-schoolers, their parents, and in the classroom. Included is an easy shofar craft and a brief paragraph about Rosh Hashanah. Recommended for all Jewish libraries. Ages: 4-6.  Reviewed by Andrea Davidso",1
"899","Delicious, Healthy Food Fast!","I love to browse through different cookbooks.  I have quite a collection, and usually go to the library to find new recipes to try before I decide to purchase the entire book.  I normally look for 3 things in a cookbook, besides delicious recipes that will work for my family.  This includes:1)  Pictures of more than 3/4 of the recipes (Color pictures are the best)2)  A spiral binding, or at least one that easily lays flat3)  New & innovative recipes that have ingredients I can easily find at a grocery storeI also prefer if the cookbook lists all of the nutrient information including sodium, fat content, protein, fiber, and carbohydrates.I picked up this book to find new ideas to make a quick meal in-between working and shuffling the kids to various sporting and school events.  Let's face it, eating out isn't always the best for you, especially since you cannot always tell exactly how much fat or sodium you are ingesting.  I wanted some new recipes to try, but not necessarily a dish that would have my kids eyeing it suspiciously and saying ""what is it?"".  I was not disappointed.The book offered many beautiful color photographs, and the pages themselves were glossy and thick...not the cheaper paper that many cookbooks use.  All of the nutrient information was included, along with a column called ""Nutrient Bonus"" that lets you know if the dish contained a lot of Vitamin C, Calcium, etc.  The book was hard cover, but the binding was loose enough that my copy easily lays flat, another good bonus so that I was not always struggling to keep my page open.  It also contains a rather large vegetarian section.Some of our favorites include: Seafood Salad with Citrus Vinaigrette, Bistro Beef Salad, Vietnamese Style Beef & Noodle Broth, Mock Risotto, Chicken Stuffed with Golden Onions & Fontina, Almond Crusted Chicken Fingers, Beer-Battered Tilapia with Mango Salsa, and Loaded Twice Baked Potatoes.

"808","Emotional Intelligence 10 years on","There is about as much additional science in Social Intelligence, compared to Emotional Intelligence, as you could write on a postcard : mirror neurones and spindle cells.   Nevertheless, we can be thankful that Daniel Goleman chose to pay his tax bills this way.  Firstly, it serves to bring back the lessons of the earlier book to best-seller awareness, which is goodness.  Secondly, it re-casts them more clearly in an inter-personal format.  Note that this already existed in Emotional Intelligence, but was not so clearly called out.  The most positive aspect is the confirmation provided by fMRI studies to previous empirical or intuitive knowledge on the importance of inter-personal relationships to psychic ecology.  A question-mark would be against the reliance on Seligman's and Csikszentmihalyi's questionnaire based results.  Questionnaire psychology is frustratingly limited in the gap between the suggestive nature of the results and the impossibilty of distinguishing between correlation and cause-effect",1

"772","Can you imagine Hell?  These six people can.","It's pretty impressive to think that a book like ""Hiroshima"" was written, and appreciated, less than a year after the atomic bomb was dropped.  John Hersey took a bold step in investigating the lives and experiences of those who were on the receiving end of the birth of the Atomic Age.Interviewing six survivors, Hersey assembled a snapshot of what it was like have an atomic bomb dropped on your city.  Pure luck and circumstances determine if you survive or not.  The color of your clothing means everything.  White clothes reflect the heat, while dark clothing absorbs it.  Even if you survive the initial blast, what you see next might make you wish you hadn't.  But human beings are stubborn creatures, and seem to keep going even in the most hellish circumstances.I have been to the Hiroshima Peace Park several times, and have seen the human face of the atomic bomb up close and personal.  It is a humbling experience, and one that forever changed my opinions on war as a means of settling disputes.  Hersey's book has a similar impact, being told in such a clinical, observational writing style that you can't help but be moved by the reality of it all.My one criticism of ""Hiroshima"" is the cast of characters that Hersey chose to showcase.  For some reason, they seem to be largely Christian, including a German Jesuit priest and a Japanese Methodist minister.   With Christians being such a tiny percentage of the Japanese population, considerably less than 1%, the choice to interview Japanese Christians seems a deliberate one.  Hersey is telling the largely-Christian US readers, ""See? They aren't heathen devils.  They are Christians, just like you and me.  That's who we dropped the bomb on. That's who we killed.""   This puts in question the journalistic neutrality of the book, and has Hersey in the light of putting across an agenda instead of simpling reporting what was",1

It should be in every school and public library (preferably next to the biology books that have been stickered with pro-creationist caveats).My only complaint is the title. Perhaps it should have been called ""The Critical Thinkers' Reference"" so as not to confuse those poor mites who cannot differentiate between rational thought and Cartesian Skepticism.  Of course, if your world-view is not based on rational thinking and evidence, then the knowledge contained in this book may make you feel uncomfortable.  You may even feel threatened to the point that you negatively review it.

"337","Simply the best art critic","I agree with the first reviewer: this is what art criticism, politically engaged or not, should read like.  Berger was an old-time Marxist; I am an Anglosphere conservative.  He is a man of the Left; I am of the Right.  No matter, his essays are the most wonderful introduction to art criticism, and at times philosophy, that I have read.  Incredibly perceptive, sensitive, without empty sentimentality but filled with genuine sentiment and deep empathy for the human condition, Berger can make any painting or work of art say more than even its author may have intended.  He uses history but is not a historicist, for  he lets the works reveal themselves openly.  The essay ""That which is held,"" a philosophic vindication of romantic love through an analysis of ""time"" is a near masterpiece of the essay form worthy of Montaigne.  Berger  will be missed in the barren landscape of contemporary Europe.  Danto and the Americans are simply not in his league",1

"802","Classic statement of animal liberation","In the 1970's, Peter Singer came out with a radical argument which was new in the field of ethics; animal liberation.  While some philosophers and others had in the past, argued for the necessity of being kind to animals (Schopenhauer probably being the most notable case because of his deep respect for Buddhism), Peter Singer was probably the first philosopher in Western philosophy to set out a systematic rational set of arguments for regarding the rights of animals.  Singer's primary argument, and a very interesting one, is science has demonstrated we show very close connections to many kinds of animals, particularly in the structures of our vital organs, nervous systems and brains.  Singer gathers some strong evidence from biology showing how many animal species are apparently capable of feeling pain and hence of suffering.  On these grounds Singer argues animals are entitled to certain rights, at least when they are being used by humans.  The fact animals can suffer means we can't just treat them as another form of material object or resource for our use, but we need to consider them as fellow beings.  Singer builds up a set of arguments against eating animals, using animals in agricultural contexts, using animals for scientific experimentation, or using animals for commercial research such as the testing of cosmetic products.  Singer draws on some infamous and damning experiments which seem to have caused terrible pain and suffering to animals for little apparent gain in scientific knowledge, including the use of 'rape racks' and virtual torture of infant monkeys in one series of experiments.  At the end of the book, Singer presents several vegetarian recipies and hopes readers will stop eating meat on this example.Singer's work has been very powerful in its influence, and several philosophers built on and expanded on his work.  However, others have criticized his arguments quite strongly, on many grounds.  It has also become a kind of manifesto for many animal rights campaigners and animal liberationists, some of whom have resorted to violent means to 'free' animals from scientific experimentation.While I admire Singer's rigorous arguments as well as the formidable evidence he marshals to back it, I cannot entirely agree with them.  It seems that at least some scientific research involving animals is necessary for fighting many awful diseases and conditions which cause terrible human suffering.  I think a total ban on animal research, especially medical research and biotechnology research aimed at improving human health, is excessive.  Animals also form an essential part of the livelihood of many people around the world.  No doubt in many cases some practices lead to animals suffering, but does this mean all useage of animals in agriculture should be stopped?  Where do we make changes?  When do we make them?  I certainly agree agriculture should be done in such a way animal cruelty is removed, and suffering reduced as much as possible, but preventing all suffering is impossible, and reality will require compromise.  Also as another ecologist remarked, sometimes practices which cause harm to an individual animal is necessary to protect the overall ecosystem.  Hunting rabbits and kangeroos or cats or horses will cause suffering to these creatures, but is often a necessity in Australia where in many areas these animals are dangerous pests that ruin the native environment through overpopulation or hunting.  Still, the strongest thing in favour of Singer's thesis is that we do share a profound connection with nature, and our terrible disregard for the biosphere is coming back to haunt us in the form of mass extinctions of species.  We certainly need to redevelop a sense of what Edmund Wilson calls 'biophilia', a sense of affinity with nature and the natural world, rather than simply seeing it as another object to gratify our desires",1

"520","Indispensable resource","This is a reader that covers the various theories of nationalism as well as varieties of nationalism itself. This makes it a largely indispensable supplement, handbook and reference work for anyone interested in nationalism. This is particularly true today as the scholarship on this social phenomenon continues to grow unabated, and since it is patently obvious that nationalism hardly seems about to disappear. The reader contains important extracts from the major works on nationalism by some of the most important early theorists such as Renan, Max Weber and Stalin (although the views of Marx and Engels themselves or Lord Acton and Friedrich Meinecke would have been welcome additions) and almost all of the most important contemporary scholars (Gellner, Anderson, Connor, A.

"9","Excellent Short Fiction from one of our best stylists","John Crowley's well-deserved recognition as one of the best literary stylists writing in the English language is readily apparent in these four fantasy novellas that date from the late 1980's. His ""Great Work of Time"" is an intriguing Rashomon-esque time travel fantasy about Cecil Rhodes and British economic imperialism in East Africa at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. It was almost as compelling a read as the ""The Nightingale Sings At Night"", which offers a fantastical twist on the Adam and Eve creation myth saga. The other two tales, ""In Blue"" and ""Novelty"", I found much less compelling, but they are redeemed by the same lyrical prose Crowley uses in other tales. It was a wonderful surprise to find this book at a library; a surprise which I think many readers will also discover",1
"283","One of the best book of the ordinary language philosophy","Gilbert Ryle shows a great skill in condensing his whole argument in a succinct metaphor. On page 16, he writes: ""A foreign stranger visiting the Oxford campus is shown libraries, department buildings, and museums. Then he asks ""But where is the University?"". This is the ""category mistake"". Cartesian question ""Where is the mind?"" has a same confusion, he asserts. A famous epigram ""Ghost in the Machine"" is sometimes misinterpreted. His point is that there is NO ""ghost"". What we think ghost (spirit) does not exist (therefore ghost!).Although the philosophy of ordinary language and the logical behaviorism, the British school represented by Wittgenstein and Ryle, had an its apogee in 50's, its crux of reasoning still has an important element. I still feel the current dominant school in cognitive science such as functionalism has a long way to go, before it can make it acceptable for broader spectrum of scientists whose prime mode of thinking is purely materialistic or physicalistic.

"493","Don't Try to Read it at One Sitting","Whitman is not the world's greatest poet - that's probably Shakespeare - but he's certainly been the most influential American poetic voice over the past century. He was the first poet to take all of American life as his subject. Ever the Romantic, Whitman was also the first poet to bring Romanticism into line with everyday reality.His narcissism can be annoying, but his panoramic descriptions of life and the imagination have a singularly cumulative power.  Some of his short poems (""A Noiseless Patient Spider"" and ""To a Locomotive in Winter"")are individually memorable. The longer poem ""When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed,"" indirectly about the Lincoln assassination, is brilliant. I think most of his Civil War poems are overpraised, but ""Come Up from the Fields, Father"" is a masterpiece of its kind.On the negative side, Whitman's transcendental philosophy, which he likes to indulge at length, will strike many readers as very sappy.  His style, lots of details piled up on top of one another, grows monotonous, and readers who criticize his lack of traditional poetic craftsmanship cannot just be brushed off. My advice is to not to try to get through it all at once. The poems rarely become ""difficult,"" they just tend to blur one into the other. Which may actually have been Whitman's intention.Overall,there's never been a book quite like ""Leaves of Grass,"" in any edition, and that's why it keeps selling as a true classic. In other words, a very old book that people still buy and read and enjoy even when no teacher is telling them to. Reading it will get you as close as one book can to actually living in nineteenth-century America, with all its follies, inequities, and promise",1

I share the Booklist reviewer's sentiment that Sandford has produced a D.C. intrigue reminiscent of Ross Thomas (a VERY good thing!).  My biggest beef with Dead Watch is the bland characterization of Jake Winter (though Sandford does do a good job of making Winter not be Lucas Davenport); nearly every other character has more personality-pizzazz.  Not to worry though, the Madison Bowe character and the breakneck speed of the story more than make up for that shortcoming.  If I'd been turning pages any faster, I'd have probably started a fire.",1

"622","Totalitarianism:  Nazism and Communism.","Hannah Arendt's _The Origins of Totalitarianism_ is a book that takes a hard look at two rival totalitarian movements in the twentieth century, Soviet Communism and Nazism, and traces their historical roots.  The book is divided into three volumes focusing on Antisemitism, Imperialism, and Totalitarianism.  The first of these volumes is concerned with the historical origins of Antisemitism.  Arendt examines some of the ways historians have dealt with the historical roots of Antisemitism.  For example, some historians have argued based on a ""scapegoat theory"" that the Jews were used as an innocent scapegoat for the world's ills.  Arendt concludes that such approaches are flawed because they fail to take into account the full historical situation of the Jews.  Arendt explores the rise of Antisemitism in the birth of the nation-state, the emancipation of the Jews, the rise of the Jewish financiers, the roles of Jews within society, and the infamous Dreyfus affair.  Of particular interest here is the role of conpiracy theories concerning such individuals as Benjamin Disraeli or the infamous forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  The idea that the Jews constitute a race or are members of secret societies or clubs played an important role in the historical development of Antisemitism.  The second of the volumes in this book is concerned with the rise of Imperialism.  Here, a discussion of racism and racial thinking is examined involving such racial theorists as Count Arthur de Gobineau and various forms of Social Darwinism.  The role of the Boers in South Africa is looked at and a thorough examination of the lives of such individuals as Cecil Rhodes, who called for the creation of a secret society of aristocratic Nordic elite, is made.  The great Pan Movements, Pan-Slavism, Pan-Germanism, and the Pan-Arabism of T. E. Lawrence are dealt with and their subsequent roles in the creation of the totalitarian states is explored.  The final volume of this book is concerned with Totalitarianism proper.  Here, the role of propaganda and the secret police, as well as terror and the concentration camps are dealt with in their place in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.  Arendt explores each of these issues and shows why they are so particularly disturbing.  Arendt contends that totalitarianism sought to annihilate the nature of man completely.  Repression and terror abound within the totalitarian state and freedom is virtually nonexistent.  Written during the Cold War period and just after the Second World War, this book takes an important look into the minds of such totalitarian leaders as Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin.  Their movements of Nazism and Soviet Communism continue to haunt the modern world even though they have been largely extinguished.  The book is important today not only for historical reasons, but also because it gives a unique view of the world within a totalitarian society and the unique political danger that such totalitarian movements and institutions causes for the modern world",1

"163","A woman built the Brooklyn Bridge","While the Brooklyn Bridge is the oldest of the bridges crossing the East River, it's one of the strongest, sturdiest and will most likely outlast the Manhattan and Williamsburg bridges. John Roebling and his son, Washington, did not know how the forces of nature and bridge loads would affect their bridge. Given this gap in their knowledge they overcompensated by building a bridge capable of withstanding forces many times greater than would ever be applied to their structure. But the Roeblings' gaps in knowledge also worked against them. One of the most interesting portions of the book is where McCullough discusses the pressurized caissons beneath the East River where Washington Roebling and many his workers spent their time. Few doctors or engineers at the time knew how high pressure environments would affect the human body. The quick changes in pressure killed workers and left many, including Washington, with a condition known as the bends. Washington's wife, Emily, was forced to transform herself into chief engineer while Washington struggled with the bends.There are lots of fascinating facts and tidbits throughout this book on the bridge and the people involved with its construction.   McCullough's book is much more about the politics and people behind Brooklyn Bridge rather than the engineering. I would have preferred to read more about the engineering techniques, but I  still found this book reasonably engaging.",1

The boom will hit us in industries that we have competitive advantage in and will then expand into the financial sector once enough excess labor is absorbed in the competitive advantage industries that wages go up as companies compete for workers.  Since so many of our publicly-traded companies outsource and have significant overseas manufacturing operations, they are using that cost-savings in order to finance the implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley.  The net effect is that Sarbanes-Oxley is being digitally enforced throughout the global operations of U.S. publicly-traded companies.  This is part of the reason why you hear of increasing unrest in many emerging markets.  Large portions of their economies are being reshuffled in order to digitally align with our securities laws.

"603","A Comprehensive Survey of Classical Literature","A useful reference work for anyone interested in the literature of the ancient world, The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature is arranged alphabetically and contains encyclopedic entries for all of the major authors and their particular works, Greek and Latin gods, mythological characters, histories of Greece and Rome, major historical figures, and relevant places. The original edition of the 1930s by Sir Paul Harvey became a classic of its own and was intended by the author to be a handbook of information for readers of the Greek and Latin authors and of modern works that touched upon the classical world. The current second edition is edited by Margaret Howatson, who revises and enlarges the Harvey edition. She notes that while a few of the entries on technical subjects were written with classical specialists in mind, the book generally requires no knowledge of Greek or Latin and is intended for anyone curious to find out more about the classical world.An ideal companion for any reader interested in Greek or Latin literature and history",1
"160","A much needed focus","	'Conservatives Without Conscience' does nothing less than expose the matrix of political illusion with a comprehensive framework of science.  There is much more that could be said about the authoritarian character structure and the history of the science, but John Dean does a good job of explaining the basics, and how it applies to our modern political landscape. 	 This is not new information, it has just been sequestered in the hands of academics and the Carl Rove wing of the Republican party.  The academics keep measuring and refining their understanding, and Carl Rove and his party keeps using the information to manipulate the american public.  Finally, someone mainstream has laid it out for all to see.  Knowledge is power, so everyone should read his book.  However, one lesson to be learned from this book is that closed mindedness is a hallmark trait of the authoritarian character, so this is not a book written to convert anyone with strong authoritarian character traits.  They don't tend to read books much anyway.  It is a book  for the open minded, that will put into context our mean spirited political landscape,  the by any means necessary tactics of many named players, and the proto-fascist movement that has hijacked our country. 	John Dean pulls no punches.  He names names and kicks butt.  He gets a little dry when trying to define his wing of conservatism as opposed to neo conservatism, but even that is well worth the effort.  If you have a shred of unease about the leaders of the Republican party and those who  unquestionably support them, then read this book.  It is an eye opener",1
"85","Mr. Lynch Shares More of His Expertise...","When Peter S. Lynch speaks, wise investors will listen.  This book covers the famous fund manager's career at the helm of Fidelity Magellan from 1977 to '90, and post career into '92.  It's far more introspective than ""One Up On Wall Street"" and it was no doubt meant to be for this purpose.  For example, there isn't nearly as much fundamental principles for stock picking outlined in this book as the former.  My belief is that the reader would do best by reading ""One Up On Wall Street"" first and follow up with this title, as its the newer of the two, regardless. Peter's style of writing (with John Rothchild) is no-nonsense and easy to take in.  To my knowledge three books have been published by the duo and all three have been entertaining and never dry.  The reader can comfortably take in some very important stock-picking principles from one of the greats without feeling intimidated at any point.  I think this is a sign of a well written book that covers a topic that isn't child's play (unless you like playing with money).And although this book doesn't cover nearly as much technical information as the first, it still offers a lot of tasty tidbits for stock pickers.  I made plenty of notes while reading ""Beating The Street"", and I'm confident that I'll be well served by doing so.  Peter reiterates many of the guidelines he mentioned in his first best-seller, such as scrutinizing company earnings and the balance sheets, and he gives his wise opinion of picking bargain stocks that have lower P/Es than their growth rates.Overall, this title definitely deserves four stars, and his first book deserves at least five stars.  Lynch and Rothchild have authored several investing books that will stand the test of time. You'll sleep better with your investment decisions by having these valuable classics in your collection.

"596","An epic portrayal of an important, maligned truth.","Ayn Rand's masterwork earns its reputation as a monumentally influential book.  It is at least as important today as it was when it was published in 1957.  Altas Shrugged lays out, in the form of a sprawling novel, Rand's philosophy, Objectivism.  It has been said in a couple of different surveys that the book is ranked by Americans as the second most influencial to them, trailing only the Bible.Atlas Shrugged covers a lot of philosophical ground, but at its heart is a story that drives home the importance of the people who produce disproportionately in society; people who invent, design, build, manufacture, improve and manage.  She lays out the a story of a society that resents these people and their wealth despite the fact that they earned it and that they improved everyone's standard of living while they improved their own.  Mysteriously, society's producers start vanishing, one at a time until almost none are left.  The outcome and the explanation are fun reading while they make an important point.Our society has been wealthy enough for long enough that it is way too easy to take that wealth for granted and forget where it comes from.  The decisions we make when we fail to keep in mind the source of the wealth do really have the power to make our standard of living go away.  Rand reminds us of this critical, but easily forgotten lesson in an eloquent way.Read it and then tell ten friends to read it too.  More of us need to see this side of the story.

"821","Will There Be Pi in The Sky By and By When You Die?","Barrow, an astronomer at the University of Sussex when this book was published, provides an entertaining and informative account of the foundations and philosophy of mathematics.  Do mathematicians invent or discover mathematics?  What 'reality' do mathematical entities like pi have?  What accounts for what physicist Eugene Wigner has called, in a now-famous paper, ""The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences"" (299)?  After an interesting account of the history of counting and numbers, Barrow discusses in succeeding chapters the philosophies of formalism, inventionism, intuitionism, and platonism, a sophisticated version of which he seems to favor.  Perhaps most mathematical workers follow what Alfred Korzybski called ""the 'christian science' school of mathematics, which proceeds by faith and disregards entirely any problems of the epistemological foundations of its supposed `scientific' activities"" (Science and Sanity 748).  I commend Barrow because he considers these epistemological questions important and writes about them so engagingly.  Barrow's discussions of theories and personalities provide useful background for understanding mathematical foundations.  As for Barrow's conclusions, from a non-aristotelian view, the appeal of platonism seems understandable as an example of identification, the confusion of orders of abstracting.  Barrow doesn't seem to consider that mathematicians may both invent and discover mathematics.  He seems so taken with the effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences that the notion of mathematical entities existing solely as high-order abstractions in human nervous systems seems insufficient to him.  As Korzybski pointed out, we live in a world of multi-dimensional, ordered structures or relations.  It does not seem unreasonable, then, that we can map this world with an exact language of relations, i.e., mathematics.  But as Korzybski also pointed out many times, ""the map is not the territory.&quot",1

"424","""To have committed no fault, yet to be so entirely alone...""","NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a significant Dickens in the uncannily absorbing way the narrative diversifies to various literary discourses. The protagonist's experiences and encounters in adverse milieu through life not only embody melodrama, comic relief, political satire, class comedy, social criticism, and domestic farce, they allow Dickens the opportunity to portray, to the minutest nuance, an extraordinary cast of rogues and eccentrics. The main frame of NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a quintessential Dickens: a generic, virtuous man who concerns with the affair of establishing his identity as a gentleman and the pruning of whom entwines him in a checkered fate. Nicholas Nickleby has committed no fault and offenses, and yet he is to be entirely alone in the world, to be separated from the people he loves, and to be proscribed like a criminal. The more unbearable the ordeals and the more injudicious the deal of the hand from life, the more profusely the novel accentuates Dickens' outrage at the cruelty and social injustice.When Nicholas Nickleby is left exiguous after his father's death, he turns to his hard-hearted uncle to solicit succor. But Ralph Nickleby, a most unscrupulous and avarious man he is, demonstrates that he is proof against all appeals of blood and kindred, and is steeled against every tale of distress and sorrows. The man will never fail to exert any resolution or cunning that will promise increase of money for there is scarcely anything he will not have hazarded to gratify his greed. It's not that he is unconscious of the baseness of the means with which he acquires his gains. He cares only for gratification of his passions of avarice and hatred. He might have from the beginning conceived dislike to his nephew whom he brazenly places in Squeers' Dotheboys Hall, a school for unwanted boys, as an assistant master. The cruelty of Squeers, who's coarse and ruffian behavior even at his best temper, Nicholas has been an unwilling witness. The filthy condition of the school and the bodily distortion of the boys impart in him a dismal feeling. The thought of being a helper and abettor of such squalid practice fills his with honest disgust and indignation. The cruelties descend upon helpless infancy fuel this rightful indignation in Nicholas, who interferes with the schoolmaster's flogging a boy named Smike and astonishes everyone in school.Not only does Ralph persuade Nicholas' family to renounce him for the atrocities to Squeers of which he is guilty, he also betrays his niece Kate into the company of some libertine men who are clients of his and who speak of her in a most casual, lecherous, ribald and vulgar terms. She is roused beyond all endurance by a profusion of compliments of which coarseness becomes humor and of which vulgarity softens down to the most charming eccentricity. The mutual hatred between uncle and nephew aggravates as Nicholas overhears conversations about his sister. The hidden feud further percolates to the surface and leads to a pitch to its malignity as he tries to rescue a girl from a marriage to which she has been impelled. As the uncle insidiously hatches a scheme to retaliate against his nephew who has in every step of the way interceded and thwarted his plans for mercenary gains, Nicholas entwines with a cast of characters who are humorous, memorable, and true to life. Peripheral to his molding to become a gentleman are episodes of political satire, theatrical success, courtship, family farce, and chicanery. The most significant character is no doubt Smike, whom Nicholas saves from the hellish grip of the schoolmaster and has become his best friend. Nicholas' unfailing love and protectiveness toward the boy accentuates his being the novel's hero, whose domestic virtues, affections, compassion, and delicacy of feelings qualifies him to his later fortune and does him justice.NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a flamboyantly exuberant work in which Dickens wreaks the tension of his social satire to a pitch. Details on the Yorkshire school offer such magnifying vision of the cruelty, filthiness, and despotism in the boarding schools. Nor does he spare the rogues and the greedy, whose squeamishness he sarcastically embellishes as a common honesty and whose pride as self-respect. NICHOLAS NICKLEBY also evokes the subtle problem of human nature in establishing boundary of one's remorse. Although Ralph might feel no remorse in his betraying his niece to the temptation of his libertine clients, he hates them for doing what he has expected them to do. In a sense, Nicholas is seen as the unswerving force that is determined to right the wrong of the society. He tries to appeal to the compassion and humanity of those who have gone astray and to lead them to consider the innocent and the helpless. Nicholas might embody energy for radicalism and ambition to challenge social injustice; his ultimate goal is the recovery of his ancestral position in the social hierarchy. But in the effort to undertake the good deeds, he is influenced by no selfish or personal consideration but by pity for the people he helps and detestation and abhorrence of the heartless schemes.  In the same way he is determined to appeal to his uncle's humanity and not to wreak revenge on him. But Ralph's hatred for his nephew has been fed upon his own defeat, nourished on his interference with all his schemes. NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a sober social commentary woven with social and domestic issues. Woven in one man's aspiration to restore family's ancestral dignity is Dickens' own musing, monologues, teachings on the soul, the life, and the moral. The discourse at times assumes a voice of despondency, sobriety and indignation.",1
"784","Revisionism at its Best","Ironically, socialist, anti-American, iconoclastic Professor Taylor, could be, at least in this work, the inspiration for the great David Irving's more pathbreaking work on an unneccesary and destructive war.  It is demonstrated that Adolph Hitler, the popular Nationalist German leader, was no more responsible, and in many ways less so, than the so-called Allies, who foolishly guaranteed Poland, only to give her over to jewish Bolshevism at Yalta.  By refusing to grant Germany's rightful place as a continental power, Britain and France lost millions of lives, their world empires, and their economic prominence.  The sole beneficiaries of this needless conflict were the Soviets and their Western fellow travellers.  And upon the final dissolution of the evil empire, courtesy of one Dutch Reagan, we have a European continent completely dominated by...Germany",1
"317","Confusing, Hilarious, Profound","Lost in the Funhouse can be a very bewildering and irritating collection if you aren't in the right mood for it.  If you aren't well-versed in post-modern fiction (barthelme, calvino, etc are good reference points) you might want to start somewhere else first.  Even Barth's novels are more immediately digestible.With that said, though, this collection doesn't really operate on one consistent level.  Perhaps this is because many of these stories were written by Barth much earlier in his career.  The three stories concerning Ambrose's birth and development are very straightforward and enjoyable on a surface level until the whole series goes flying into left-field with the titular ""Lost in the Funhouse"" story (which Barth is probably most known for).  From that point on, most of the stories are more about the process of writing and the relationship between the reader, writer, and the characters.  Stories like ""Title"" and ""Life-Story"" work more as essays on the nature of fiction than actual works of fiction, and were (for me at least) a little tedious.  The best moments occur when Barth combines his thoughful analysis on the nature of writing and art with a really good ground-situation, typically based on Greek mythology.  The best of these are the utterly raunchy ""Petitition"" and the labyrinthine ""Menelaiad"".Taken as a whole, though, Lost in the Funhouse is greatly satisfying, even if (like me) you really only understood about 20% of what Barth was talking about on your first read-through.  It's the sort of book I'll go back to again and again to try and delve deeper into the mystery of the funhouse while appreciating all over the hilarious bawdy humor.Oh, and make sure to read Barth's seven additional notes at the front of the book (though maybe only after you've read the story that is being discussed in each note, so as not to ruin the initial experience)-- they really help to clarify some of Barth's intentions.  I can't even imagine appreciating a story like ""Glossolalia"" without having read the note concerning it",1
"703","Learning to Care for Yourself","Quite often, we read books for young people where the main characters must lean to care for others and not just themselves-where the main character must break away from childhood egocentrism and emerge into the adult world.  In Katherine Paterson's Lyddie, readers find the opposite theme:  Learning to not lose oneself in the responsibilities of the adult world. The novel follows Lydia Worthen, a teenager in 1840s Vermont.  With her father gone to seek his fortune, Lyddie, with some help from her brother Charlie, must take charge of the family farm, her emotionally unstable mother, and her younger sisters.  To cover the farm debt, Lyddie's mother leases the farm and sends her oldest children into forced servitude.  After a year of misery working for a local tavern, Lyddie becomes a mill hand in Lowell, Massachusetts.  While there, Lyddie's sole focus becomes earning the money to pay off the farm debt and reunite her family.  Her hard work and single-mindedness earn her a reputation as a ""skinflint"" and ""Amazon.""  It's only after the farm is sold, her youngest sister dies, her mother is sent to the asylum, her remaining siblings are adopted by another family, and her job is lost over fraudulent charges that Lyddie begins to look out for herself-that she begins to ask what she wants for herself.While Lyddie is not Paterson's best work, the book does provide lively insight to factory life in Lowell, where many young women flocked in the early 1840s for economic opportunity.  While readers are not thrown into the heart of the labor movement, we are able to see the conditions that led to organized labor: The long hours, the sexual harassment, the illness and disease resulting from mill work.  Still, all of this background provides a fitting setting for the story of a young woman who must learn that she has more to offer the world than her back-breaking labor.  If you've enjoyed Paterson's other works of historical fiction, Lyddie will not disappoint.  ",1

"577","Indubitude","If you liked Empire, you'll love Multitude. The authors and reviewers alike speak of Multitude as a follow up to Empire, but I think something very different is happening here. Hardt and Negri have pushed and pulled each other forward over a vast and forbidding territory, and in Multitude they have attained a height/depth of perception well beyond Empire. If you are attempting to learn your radicalism, or inform your progressivism, through Hardt and Negri, then you may see Multitude as continuing from and expanding Empire, and you may also join the chorus bemoaning the perceived digressiveness and discursiveness of both books. But what we actually have here are two attempts at the same fateful book: where Empire was the best try we had at the time, Multitude now succeeds. Where the digression in Empire circled around the feeling of our world-cultural hematopoiesis, the discursion in Multitude captures it.Fukuyama attempted to deal with Multitude in the July 25th NYT Book Review, and either utterly failed at, or purposefully decided to avoid, addressing the book qua philosophy. At this point in his apologizing for economists, it is hard to imagine that Fukuyama's name has ever been mentioned in the same breath as Hegel, or that he has ever actually read any of the German Idealists;- whereas with Hardt and Negri, we almost have that level of man among us again. For Fukuyama, history has indeed ended, because he has stopped feeling it and can now only move around his darkened signifiers. For Hardt and Negri, and for those who have read, listened, and felt their way into the great becoming that is world history, we are indeed not at its end, but at its very beginning. The chief problem with this book is that the English language, as a field of common meaning, is not up to handling this level of thought anymore. (E.g., the very British cheery insufficiency of George Monbiot's 'Manifesto for a New World Order'.) Hardt and Negri wrote Multitude in English, but were thinking in German, that neoplatonic lego of a language. So, if you consider yourself progressive but can't get the feeling and sweep of Multitude, then trash your TV, stop reading anything written after 1930 for a few years, then come back to it. You will find you have become allergic to CNN, but you will also find that - finally - you can *feel* what the world and her history are all about.",1
"365","Please translate more of Kirino's work into English!","On the surface, Natsuo Kirino gives us a book loaded with nail-biting, page turning suspense.  What lies beneath is a scathing commentary on the social climate for women in Japan.  Women are seen as beautiful young pets, or useless old bags.  Kirino shows a side of Japan that I didn't know existed.Kirino's brilliant characterization makes this book work.  Every person is fleshed out within the context of the story, and flashbacks are only used when absolutely necessary.  I never felt like the story was on hold while I learned about someone's childhood.  I can't stand it when writers stop a story cold just to fill in holes that they have created.  Kirino doesn't have that problem.The book has a bit of a slow start, but it is necessary for the author to paint a picure of the mundane world the characters live in before things start to heat up.  The story picks up momentum and charges through to a brilliant ending (I have to disagree with other reviewers who disliked the ending. If you don't like the ending, you may be missing the point of the whole book). The plot twists manage to surprise the reader without feeling forced. Kirino's style is concise and well-paced.My one complaint is that it is difficult to keep the characters straight because of their similar names.  With names like Yayoi, Yoshie, and Yoko it's hard to know who's who at times.  This may show my American ignorance, but I have to admit that this was a problem for me.This minor complaint aside, I loved this book and I highly recommend it to all fans of crime fiction",1

I was expecting it to be more of a science fiction novel but it is really a book about corporate intrigue and social commentary (i.e. the media).  That being said, I was not the least disappointed.  In his typical style, Crichton takes an aerospace engineering course and boils it down to plain English.  I learned so much about the construction of airplanes and the airline industry - it was fascinating.  He also does a great job in raking the mass media over the coals - which was fun (and somewhat ironic from the creator of ""ER"")!The book is fast paced and reads like a movie - which I am sure is no coincidence by Crichton ;)  The main character is very likeable and you find yourself rooting for her.  There are a number of plot twists and surprises and it certainly keeps you turning the pages.In summary I would not say that this is Crichton's best work, but it is surely a very enjoyable book that I would recommend to everyone",1
"500","It's not a product, it's a process!","Bruce Schneier offers an excellent 'big picture' overview of the computer security field. From types of attacks, to algorithm security to security in the context of your data center, you get a full overview of the current practices and consequences arising from them. The author argues for security as a process, not a product; security is not something you can add to your product after the fact. Starting from the product specification, down to your last outsourced programmer, security has to permeate your organization for it to work. Building 'attack trees', relying on peer review and enforcing liability are all suggestions advanced by Bruce Schneier. Secrets and Lies is a well organized book with plenty of real world examples, problems and solutions. Buy a copy for yourself, and many more for everybody else you know, we will all benefit in the end. ",1
"714","Excellent adventure novel ","Exciting and highly entertaining story about 3 men who travel to the centre of the earth through an extinct volcano. Here they come across prehistoric forests, a giant subterranean sea inhabited by prehistoric marine dinosaurs, and some ancient offshoots of man. Although some of the science bits are outdated, implausable and sometimes drag a little, the book is still surprisingly modern and fresh after 140 years. Maybe the first adventure novel of this kind and certainly of influence on modern culture.",1
"682","A great basic cookbook","If you are a gourmet chef this book may be far too basic for you but it is great for a beginner like me.  I have two kids under the age of two and have been able to cook a decent meal from this cookbook every night for the past month that I have owned it.  My husband has been very impressed with my new found cooking abilities and all but one of the meals I have fixed has been good.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has lost faith that they can ever cook well",1
"319","Eye-Opening Book for Those Interested in Place or Language","Though you may not immediately think that there is a connection between language and the places where you live and pass through, your sense of your surroundings and of language itself will be transformed after you read Gaston Bachelard's ""The Poetics of Space.""  Bachelard argues that language--especially poetry--can reveal hidden aspects of our experience of space, especially of our home space.  For example, he considers how common phrases such as ""go up to the attic"" and ""go down to the basement"" are revelatory of our typical sense that stairs to an attic are stairs one ascends, while stairs to the basement are stairs one descends--in spite of the fact that both sets of stairs must be equally ascended and descended.  As he does with other such observations, Bachelard extends his observation regarding the directionality of different staircases into a discussion of how the attic and basement hold different roles in our daily and imaginary lives.  In addition to exploring how we experience space and place, Bachelard equally attends to the way in which language can function either as a daily and common means of communication or as a site of new and creative insight; roughly speaking, he argues that poetry happens when the motions of language itself open us up to a new way of seeing or understanding something.  By reading this beautifully written and engaging book, you will likely come to understand or see anew experiences from childhood through adulthood that pertain to places where your have lived, grown up, felt comfortable or alienated, had a feeling of wonder or fear, etc.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in the experience of place or space, in language and what it can reveal to us, or in what counts as poetry rather than as common everyday language",1
"959","YES, YES, YES","I was at the SFMOMA to see her YES exhibition, and exactly what I expected, I was overwhelmed with delight... Her art is whimsically amazing. Her music touches your heart and soul. Seeing all the people there that day, I was glad that Yoko is finally getting all the respect she deserves, after all these years... Also caught her live performance at the Los Angeles's Roxy almost 6 years ago just took my breath away. I truly think she's one of the true visionaries of our time",1

"146","Kudos to Ruth","I just read this book cover to cover on a flight back to NYC from Barcelona.  My mouth watered as I read the included reprints of her past reviews of NYC restaurants - even after my five days of fantastic Spanish cuisine!  But more surprisingly, I was drawn in by what seems to be quite an honest glimpse of the NYC restaurant experience seen through the eyes of many ""characters"".  The book left me such respect for the depths that Ruth Reichl went through in order to dine as the everyday person would experience, especially in NYC's ""best"" restaurants.  Her recounts made me actually appreciate the research and dedication required to write a truly objective (as objective as food tastes get, I suppose) review.  A very easy and enjoyable read.",1
"695","Hooray For Hollywood","First off this is ""A History of Hollywood"" not ""THE History of Hollywood.""  David Thomson isn't writing the chronological, straight-up, blow-by-blow account of Hollywood movies.  ""The Whole Equation"" is an essay that takes as its question, ""are Hollywood films ever art like a Beethoven symphony or a Picasso painting?""  He says they are both more and less than that.  More because American film captures the tension between wanting to make money and wanting to say something which allows for the unintentional to happen.  That serendipity is wonderful when it works which isn't often.  Less because there are always artistic compromises as someone is always looking at the budget and thinking about the profits.And unlike most film critics he is just fine with this tension.  His argument is that to understand and appreciate American film, you have to understand that it's always about the money and about the art.  That means it is never truly art in any pure way (but is any art truly pure?). To tell you the truth, I don't think the book succeeds that well on that level.  He  points out various people and their struggles with this dilemma through out the history of American film but he doesn't developed a coherent argument that builds on his initial insight.For me, that just didn't matter.  What makes it a terrific read is that David Thomson knows and loves film.  He writes with a adolescent thrill and openness about his subject that makes it fun and poetic.  He uses the film ""Chinatown"" as his framing device and as that is my all-time favorite movie, I was in heaven.  He is not a deep thinker but his book crackles with his delight in sensations whether of the movie theater, the audience, the actors, the costumes, the music, all of it.  He constantly raises questions and throws out insights that just tumble onto each other until you realize that like watching a film, you must just suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride.",1
"329","The Great Communicator","Peggy Noonan's Reagan has the texture of truth, unlike a recent Reagan bio by Richard Reeves that has the texture of slime.  Noonan's Reagan is not hagiography;  it's clear-eyed, clean, and palpably honest.  I feel Ms. Noonan's honesty just as I felt the incredible lightness of Reeves' shallowness.  Noonan wrote her story of a great man and the building of his character as Ronald Reagan lay dying.  Now that he's gone, Peggy Noonan is our era's great communicator.  Not every word of When Character Was King is the utterly necessary word at the absolutely necessary time -- a few of her words don't fit and an occasional fact is flubbed -- but all other words of hundreds and thousands fit perfectly into the best portrait we have of a good and great man, a description also used fittingly for Dwight Eisenhower.Noonan, I believe, is the only biographer of President Reagan who understands the import of a first-term footnote, an episode that most of the world has learned to forget or, like Reeves, has learned to diminish.  That's the PATCO strike which, as Noonan shows, had world-historical implications.  By the force of his focus, President Reagan used PATCO to reassert free-world mastery in our twilight struggle with an Evil Empire that was evil and that was an empire.  Thank God we had Reagan at a moment of maximum danger.  Thank God he had Noonan to tell his story",1

Granted the sentence structure leaves alot to be deisred but use your imagination.  Draw upon your inner child and immerse yourself in the story and stop worrying about the piddly things.

We live in a world where people sell drugs that kill our kids for money and your worried about this guy making a few bucks with a writing career?  It's called priorities people, get some.  I say he should continue to write and see what he becomes.  I have read Tolkien (not just The Hobbit and LOTR - but ALL of his works).  Dark Tower, Harry Potter, and Star Wars stuff too.

With Julia Child in my kitchen, however, things are looking up! Her recipe for roast chicken was so exact that even I could not mess it up. That and the sauteed beef steaks are now my go-to dinners because they are easy and reliable.  I've also had great success with the quiche and biscuit recipes and look forward to trying breadmaking for the first time.

"256","DNA Genealogy","Serious genealogists hobbyists and professionals will be excited by this new resource, which thoroughly explains the new science of DNA testing and how it can be applied to family history research. Although this book is not for everyone, if you have successfully passed high school biology, you should be able to manage the information and its technology in this excellent reference. Wouldn't it be interesting for a man and his wife to go back in time to discover about when they might have had an ancestor in common? DNA testing and analysis had give you that and much more. It can even give you an idea what part of the world your pre-historical ancestors lived and migrated to. The authors practice what they preach and tell how we can do it too, with many DNA labs and companies listed and compared. We rated this book four hearts",1
"314","A Jamesian Curiosity, overlong but beautifully written","I liked this book, but I notice that all the critics seem to hate it. It did take me more than a year of picking at it on and off. I picked it up because Walter Laqueur referred to it in one of his books about terrorism. Written in 1886, it suggests that there is a pan-European anarchist underground, which the protagonist gets mixed up with. It is interesting in its depiction of liberal guilt among the wealthy, who support a political movement that would lead to their own extinction. The prose is wonderful, as is the depiction of the subtleties of the characters' personalities, if you have the taste for that sort of thing. All in all, it was worth reading and it passed the most important test for a novel: I finished it with regret. I had previously read and liked Portrait of a Lady, which is a superior novel. As much as I liked it, I would have to say do not start with Princess as an introduction to James. Incidentally, I have a theory about the omniscient narrator in James' books being a malign demiurge, but I will spare you that theorizing here",1
"620","The Profit Order World","Reviewers are right about this book tracing the origins of the modern surveillance state back to the birth of the modern prison system but they are not mentioning the prime motive for this that Foucault points to: profit and capitalism.  With the rise of industrial society it was more important to regiment and discipline the masses than 'off with their head' or hands.  The panopticon prison idea was taken to the factory and service industry by industial giants like Carnegie and Rockefeller and the fruits of this profitable perversion can be seen all over society today: delivery drivers monitored throughout the day by GPS, social security cards, public schooling (founded by the same industrial giants) intellectual and psychological grading, job placement and conformity, credit ratings, licences needed to do everything but go to the bathroom, a growing snitch culture...Foucault's major thesis is that surveillance (discipline) aids profit and any deviation from profit leads to state-sanctioned punishment in the form of increased surveillance.  As industry and profits increase so will the surveillance and discipline that make it run smoothly.  Every facet of modern society works to this end.  The irony is, as techno-pundits like McCluhan later pointed out, in the modern world the prisoner with a tv set has as much denatured freedom as the tycoon in his guarded estate and they enjoy a lot of the same things in a world where pleasure is increasingly programmed and vicarious; in a world that has turned from the moral order to the profit order, where bad credit today is the profit order version of the ancient moral order idea of excommunication.  Everything that stands in the way of the profit order, whether it be an idea, person, religion, or country is attacked.  Bottom line, we are all 'human resources' in the political economy, in the religion of capital: packaged and packed like a bunch of sardines with the capitalist state and its laws protecting the tabernacle of profit over all else.  The inanity and inherent fraud of our system, not to mention the explosion of prison populations and an insane consumer society, makes a lot more sense after being traced by a renegade like Foucault.  Of all his books this is also the easiest read.  This is a beautiful book by a complicated man.  by the way, he taught at the University of Buffalo for a short time. ",1

"138","An essential book for art lovers!","I was fortunate enough to have seen the now-legendary Vermeer exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. during the winter of 1995-96.  21 out of the 35 (or 36) extant paintings by Vermeer were included in the show, offering a unique opportunity to see the bulk of Vermeer's amazing works in a single space, something that no one has experienced since 1696, when @20 of his paintings were auctioned in Delft.  Given the rarity and fragility of Vermeer's works, it is unlikely that such an event will ever be repeated. All who were unable to make it to the show, however, have this splendid book as a document of this unique event.  This book will remain the standard work on Vermeer for many decades, and represents the fruit of several years' labor by art historians on two continents. Because so little is in fact known about Vermeer the man (in truth, we have no idea at all what Vermeer's education, interests, and personality were like), the catalogue essays fill this gap by contextualizing Vermeer's work within the history of Dutch painting, the development of perspective, and the fascinating tale of Vermeer's ""rediscovery"" in the 19th century and his richly-deserved rise to worldwide fame. The essays and catalogue entries may be too technical for some readers, as the authors have expended a lot of effort to reconstruct Vermeer's exact technique, something which can only be gleaned from careful study of the paintings themselves (no drawings by Vermeer have survived, nor have any statements he may have made about painting).  This extensive scholarly apparatus, while illuminating and occasionally even riveting (the essay dealing with Vermeer's rediscovery is a great detective narrative!), tends to obscure the strange, even uncanny emotional charge that his images are suffused with.  Vermeer's personal world - so limited in content yet unforgettably haunting and evocative - is one of stillness and peace suffused with tension.  Each image contains remarkable spatial and temporal ambiguities that make simple scenes like a lady writing a letter while her maid looks away or two people standing near a piano (The Music Lesson) vibrate with dramatic tension.  Sadly, the somewhat passionless writing encases the pictures (all of which are superbly reproduced) in a rhetoric that does not address the fundamental issue: What is it about these paintings that is so powerful that their maker was rescued from total obscurity and has inspired poetry, novels and countless studies?  I was hoping to find some discussion of the psychological meaning of these images, but the traditional (overly scholarly and dry) art history within did nothing to help me understand my passion for the ""Sphinx of Delft.""  That said, the book is a masterpiece of empirical research on the artist (barring some new discovery, it is unlikely that we will ever have any more facts about Vermeer and his world than can be read here), exquisitely designed, and distinguished with beautiful reproductions.  The volume is certainly one of the few bestsellers in the field of the art book - when I attended the show, the paperback print of the book was totally sold out and the hardcover was flying off the shelves (it is odd that the book has not been reprinted in paperback).  Johannes Vermeer is THE text to have on this artist and is unlikely to be superseded anytime soon.  Immerse yourself in Vermeer's world and you will be transformed.  Seeing this exhibition changed my life, and I treasure this book as a means of recapturing the awe and joy that overwhelmed me at the time.  I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I have",1
"336","An Excellent (and comical)  novel about family","A Late Divorce is one of my very favorites novels.  This ordinary tale about the late divorce of a middle-aged couple, one of whom is in a mental institution, is told from the perspective of each member of the family:  children, their spouses and mates, grandson,etc.  I have rarely laughed so  much, or been touched so much, by the insightful description of the Kaminka  family and their travails over a failed marriage, real estate and conflict.   The scene with the rabbis at the mental institution is literary hilarity  at its best...A wonderful work, original, illuminating and FUNNY",1

We all have men in our lives husband, father, brother, son, friend or coworker with whom the relationship is worth improving.  Keep in mind this is neither a marriage book nor a psychology book.  It is a book about men written for the women who truly care about them and the relationships they have with men.  There is a companion book written about women for men appropriately titled, ""For Men Only.""  Perhaps those who were offended by this book should give that one a try.I found this book to be both touching and challenging.  Very Good book!!!",1

Written in 4-5 completely different chapters there is some supernatural, but it begins as a story of some friends in childhood, follows them through the years & culminates with them as adults. Each chapter is completely different yet ties some characters in. At the end they are all tied together in some ways years later. It's ingenious in it's finale and I advise you set aside some time for reading. It's very difficult to put down. Once it grabs your interest, it just sucks you into the story. If you remember your childhood friends (we all do) you'll identify with the story ",1

Reading about the astoundingly crazy life Mary Karr had as a child made me wonder how her sense of humor could be so sharp and perfect and still get across the sadness and pathos without making me feel bad or hopeless.

I kept turning the pages to find out their secrets. Deceptive and abusive uncle Theo as well as murder scenes make the story more thrilling and a suspense. The Virgin Bride also comes in handy and she is an angel rather than a ghost for she always is encouraging and very nice. Sinjun pleasantly spices up the whole story. I can't wait any longer to read her own story The Heiress Bride",1

Every business owner needs a business plan and this is somethig that you really do have to do for yourself. Unfortunately, writing a good business plan does not come easily to many people.

Andrew Jackson's a contraverisal President. On the good side he defeated the British at the amazing Battle of New Orleans, help in expanding into the West, a great soldier, clearly loved his wife Rachel enough to duel to defend her, and was probably the only president who could threaten a state with military force if it tried to leave the Union and tough enough to make it happen. On the flip side his percusion of Indians, the Trail of Tears, his many duels makes him a very complex and sometimes hard to understand person. But still a great biography",1

"794","Practical and Very Useful Book on Software Profession as a Career","Businesses cannot exist without the IT and vice-versa. They are interdependent. IT systems automate the business processes and run 24 by 7. Therefore we cannot really view those who work at the ""Business"" level as above us.  So, I disagree with the author on this point. However, he does sort of make a U turn later on in the book.This book will make you think. For instance: What is the supply demand for programmers in a particular Business domain? This would be a good question to research so that we can plan our career.He talks about how to survive layoffs by being knowledgeable in different areas. Not everyone wants to stay in one organization for a long time. Another thing is that it is almost impractical to learn everything in a particular technology (say, Java technology). Developers will have different intentions, for example they might have a backup plan in case of IT downturn, either by having a cash cushion or generating cash flow through software products.I agree about following your passion. It enables us to transcend limitations. It inspires us and makes us reach a level of performance that amazes us. This explains the previous paragraph (which sounds like excuses).Another principle that he explains - ""Be the Worst"" is very real. Two projects, one early in my career where I had the opportunity to work with a strong and talented team of developers and project manager. Recently when I found working for people who were not anywhere near my capabilities, they did affect my performance.This book helps to see and expect what the work environment could possibly bring us and what we can do to proactively handle these situations.Maintenance is seen as a menial work and recruiters downplay any experience on it. Oh, this is a developer job...  Chad advises you to learn to love maintenance. He recommends having a mentor and I am glad I read his book. I know mentors can also come in the form of a book!!! You can have more than one mentor.I love the Eight-Hour Burn concept. This explains why I get very depressed and productivity drops during the last few weeks of the project. Now I know how to make the work stay in the office. No more nagging problems following me home!The concept of ""Presence"" is very realistic. I learned this by making mistakes in the workplace and the cost was high. I wish I had read this book early in my career. Lot of things that he explains has already happened to me in my career. Still I was able to learn how to handle those situations successfully next time around.Reading open source code really helps to solve recurring problems quickly. I have experienced this in my job. The cover of this book really needs to be improved. The content of the book is much better than the quality of cover image",1

"368","Outstanding book","Among all the theories of ethics with which I am familiar, I have always found Kant's system to be the best: carrying out one's duty for the sake of the duty itself. The problem with Kant, however, is that his theory of morality is grounded outside humanity, dependent on a source of which we can never, some may claim, have any understanding. Christine Korsgaard fixes, at least for me, this problem, by showing that one does not have to venture outside humanity in order to ground its morality. In short, the source of normativity is our humanity itself.I don't want to get into too much details and give away the main points of the book. Suffice it to say that it offers, in my opinion, some of the best arguments for the objectivity of morality. The conclusion I reached after reading the book was this: It is as much justified for a human to complain 'Why should I be moral?' as it is for him/her to complain 'Why should I have two eyes?' In both cases, the answer is 'Because you are a human being, a social animal with two eyes.'",1

"99","Another awesome thriller by Grisham.","This is the third book I have read by Grisham, and so far I have really enjoyed each one. Grisham really knows how to write a good legal thriller. This book does not have any courtroom/court-case scenes, which I really enjoy, but it still kept my attention very well. Grisham gives you just enough ""inside details"" to keep you guessing without actually telling you the answer. For example: at one point, the clues seemed to point to Fletcher Coal being involved in the killings, but that was way off the mark in the end. This characteristic of Grisham's writings makes for a very enjoyable read.One of my few complaints about this book is the sudden romance between Gray and Darby. They had hardly even met before they seemed to become attracted, then it VERY quickly blossomed into an open show of affection, even though at the same time, Darby was supposedly mourning for Thomas. Even so, that is probably the main thing that seems wrong about this book, and it does not detract from the overall quality very much at all.Overall, this is a very captivating, page-turner book that really holds your attention. I highly recommend it, as well as Grisham's other books. So far, I have found Grisham to be an awesome writer of legal thrillers. I promise that you will not be disappointed. Read and enjoy",1
"410","Innocence lost, or boys will be cruel","Golding is a deeply symbolic novelist who relies, especially in this novel and in The Inheritors (1955), on ideas from the viewpoint of evolutionary biology and anthropology.  The central symbol of The Lord of the Flies is that of a pig's head upon a stick stuck in the ground, a totem in the making perhaps, but seen by Golding as Beelzebub, the ""lord of the flies,"" the devil, a head of rotting flesh enveloped by flies.The central idea is that without civilization we will degenerate into predatory animals ruled by superstition, the will to power, and the primordial need to survive.  When Piggy's glasses, which symbolize the tools and knowledge of our culture are broken, it signals the degeneration, the return to the wild in which, as Thomas Hobbes has it, there are ""No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.""That a group of English school boys could degenerate so quickly after crash-landing on a deserted island may be seen as a bit fanciful, or more exactly, as the artifice of the artist; nonetheless, the premise of this extraordinary work may well serve as a cautionary note for our times.  Should we, through nuclear warfare, a runaway greenhouse effect, sectarian violence on a global scale, or through the exhaustion of the fossil fuels that power our civilization, regress to the state of savages, we have this warning.Instead of the noble savage, instead of a return to the Garden of Eden, instead of the Swiss Family Robinson or Robinson Crusoe, Golding takes us step by step from the world of the boy's school to life and death power struggles and a fascination with savagery to the beginnings of tribal warfare.  As in The Inheritors, Golding sees not the good in humans, but the viciousness.  In The Inheritors we homo sapiens murdered the gentle Neanderthal, here we children become gangsters of the island, on our way to becoming tribal chieftains as murderous and vengeful as the God of the Old Testament.  I understand that Golding wrote the novel in part to answer the pollyannaish naivete of R.M. Ballantyne's The Coral Island (1857), which I haven't read.Clearly cruelty is one of Golding's main themes.  Left to their own devices and without the restraint of civilization's justice, humans will be cruel sometimes just to be cruel and sometimes as a means of gaining power.  The boys Ralph and Piggy naively try to set up a democratic sort of government, but are defeated by the brutality of Jack and his will to savagery.The loss of innocence that the boys experience is seen as not the loss of something they intrinsically had, but of something superimposed upon them by civilization.  In reality, Golding is saying, there is no innocence in children, that is only a fairy tale idea to which we romantically subscribe.This is one of those novels that has found its way onto the high school or even the middle school curriculum because it is easy to read and because it is easy for young people to relate to.  But the strength of this novel lies not only in its theme and readability but in the fine characterizations of the individual boys.  As in all great works of literature, it is the combination of character and story that compels us to turn the pages, and invites our admiration.It should be noted that Golding deliberately left out one of the central drives of humans, probably because he did not want to muddy up his theme of savagery, or perhaps because he felt the task too great or perhaps because he didn't find the task palatable.  I am referring to the lack of sexuality in the novel.  Not only are there no girls on the island, but the boys do not, at least overtly, involve themselves in sex.  We can see that Golding's artistry anticipated this criticism since it can be argued that the boys in this situation and at their tender age are not yet ready to express themselves sexually.  I wonder if postmodern psychology would agree.  Certainly Freud would not.Bottom line: a great read, a terrific adventure, but not a book in my opinion that should be read by preteens, in other words, you need to be older than the characters in the book in order to read the book without fear of nightmares",1
"529","Flavorful, fast-paced and entertaining","Okay, the title is a bit much.  But I enjoyed this book tremendously.  Some of the criticisms point to the elements I liked best.  The routine cases, how they were approached, and the results were a revelation to someone who has no real idea of police work except what I've seen on ""Cops"" (constant action and crisis!).  There was a new story on every page, and I wound up reading until 1 a.m. on a work day because I just couldn't help reading ""one more page"".  The descriptions of the surroundings, the characters, the sounds and smells of the settings, conjured up a real sense of being there.  I was fascinated by the character faults and virtues of the people in the book, as Atkinson tried to remain true to McCain's philosophy that most people aren't entirely good or bad.  As a resident of the area, I finally understand the gang wars that were taking place when I was growing up (I remember the old Boston Record American newpaper with the crime scene photos splashed across the front).  I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who lives in the Northeast, and to others who'd like a glimpse into how Boston politics are practiced in every profession",1
"609","Engaging and illuminating","Before reading this book, I'd had a much more black-and-white (sc., mostly black) impression of Jewish life in medieval and early modern Europe. This cogently-writtten volume presents a much more nuanced picture. Ghetto walls were an injustice, but also a refuge for many Jews from the tense environment around them. Oddly enough, this circumstance contributed to the relatively large number of conversions to Christianity in the liberal West after the Napoleonic liberations (in contrast to the shtetl Jews in Poland and Russia, who lived side-by-side with Gentile neighbors). Katz's discussions of of Jewish martyrs during the First Crusade and the flexibility of rabbinic responsa, among other topics, are also quite fascinating. ",1
"74","Anyone who makes decisions should read this","This is not a book about management.  It is a wonderful exploration about how and why groups of individuals can and do make better decisions than individuals.  It sets out some necessary conditions for this wisdom to be able to take place and then does some excellent analysis of why that happens.  What I got out of this book was some very important ideas about why collaborative decision making is important and how to assure that it is done well (If you want the other side Irving Janis' old classic on Groupthink is a good counterpoint.)  Unlike a lot of other big idea books this one is very literate and readable.  It is a joy to read but it also offers some very substantive ideas",1
"54","Hugh Hewitt Needs to Spend More Time Rebuking Crybaby Republicans","Hugh Hewitt is right on target encouraging Republicans to remain loyal to President George W. Bush.  We are confronted with a long term fight against Islamic nihilists.  The Democrats who dominate that party nationally are essentially pacifists trapped in the mindset of the countercultural excesses of the 1960s.  Indeed, if the Democratic Party returns to power, the war on terror will be severely compromised---if not lost.  Even theological modernists like myself recognize that the Republican Party also best represents the values required to underpin a viable social order.  And yes, we need to purify our ranks and rid ourselves of back stabbers like Senator Lincoln Chafee.  But what about the Republican crybabies who threaten to severely damage the party if it fails to cater to their excessive demands?  These folks may be our greatest threat in the elections of 2006.  Many of them possess a suicidal Nietzschean streak.  In their heart of hearts, they idiotically believe we should let the Democrats win so that the Republican Party can be ""purified.""  The author has yet to sufficiently deal with this crisis.  Hopefully, he starts to do so real soon before it's too late.The crybaby Republicans are particularly dangerous concerning the explosive illegal immigration issue.  A number of them come across as nativists who despise Hispanics.  We cannot, however, forget that the children of numerous illegal aliens are often American Citizens.  They get to vote at the age of 18---and will most certainly seek revenge on the GOP for harassing their parents.  Let's get something straight: we are also not going to send an estimated 10-12 million people back to their original homeland.  But aren't these individuals breaking the law?  Human law is not about the striving for utopian perfection.  Yucky sausage making compromises are occasionally required.  I may have a few complaints about Hugh Hewitt's newest book.  Still, you need to purchase a copy.  His overall advice is indispensable if you truly love your family and wish to protect the United States from ruin. David ThomsonFlares into Darkness",1

It is hard to grasp as you must actually do the experimentation.  I also thought the illustrations should be in color since that is what the book is about.

"206","One of the most influencial books I've read this year.","Having been born in 1981 I was educated as a teen about the importance of safe sex and the realities of HIV and AIDS. But, this book brought home the true horrors of the history of the pandemic. While lengthy, it is extremely informative and, if read with an open mind, refreashingly unbiased.

"739","Sharp insight from Virginia Postrel","I consider myself an optimist and insightful person, but somehow managed to miss many of Postrel's insights. She gives me even more hope that the future is going to be more wonderful than I previously thought. She does keep that hope in check, though, by talking about the enemies of the future- primarily protectionists and those that see free trade as a threat, instead of the blessing that it is. She thoroughly destroys the notion that 'there is nothing new under that sun'. While the universe, therefore our earth, is necessarily finite, we misunderstand this finiteness because we misunderstand the different combinations things can be arranged in. For example, a deck of cards has only 52 cards, but the number of combinations you can put the cards into is 52x51x50x49x...x3x2x1, which is a number larger than the number of particles in the universe! So whenever you shuffle a deck of cards, you can rest assured, that that is probably the one and only time that arrangement of cards will ever be in existence... ever. People are so inventive and creative and always looking for new things. Obviously, there will always be new things. Every time someone declares that we are nearing the end of history, science, technology, etc. it's safe to say they have no idea what they are talking about. We need to let people be as creative and as inventive as they can. It will only make our lives better, on the whole. There will always be setbacks, but as long as people can think, we will always find a way to make out of those setbacks. The book is a stunning, intelligent look at modern life. I liked it so much, I bought The Substance of Style, which is, yet, another insightful look at modern life.",1
"339","level headed reading: Jesus in his own context","in order to properly understand the Jesus of the new testament, instead of making a Jesus of our own liking, it is necessary to understand Jesus as he himself indicated.  Jesus himself, according to the new testament, made constant reference and allusion to the hebrew scriptures, ( old testament ), as he sought to explain himself, his actions, his teachings and his significance.  Understanding the old testament is therefore of paramount importance for understanding what Jesus was and is about. This means far more than knowing some of the messianic proof texts or knowing about Noahs ark or the temple and sacrificial system of the ancient hebrews.  Understanding the old testament involves knowing the overall aim and purpose of it, and how it all is held together by connected themes that form a unified whole.  Christopher Wright's book, Knowing Jesus Through the Old Testament, is an absolute Godsend towards getting the drift of the old testament and how it carries forward to the Jesus of the new testament.  This book is a little bit technical at times, it is not a devotional work, but reading this book will educate a person to accurately understand what the old testament is about and how it flows into the person of Jesus, thereby expositing the true meaning and intent of Jesus according to the background that Jesus himself referred to.    Thanks Chris Wright for this fabulous book. Also see his forthcoming book, The Mission of God, due out in fall of 2006 by intervarsity press. It looks to be another bullseye!!  For some other great little books on Jesus that are sane and sober, see:  Jesus and His World by Peter Walker,  The Original Jesus by N.T. Wright, and for a bit of a larger work see Jesus and The Gospels by Craig Blomberg",1

Her wit is biting and at it's best in this collection, favourite reads are for the individual to decide, however, for me, as well as cheering me up with her razor sharp observation and almost cruel wit. Parker also saddens me for her wit must have been based on the cynacism of one who viewed her life as overindulged and wasted by circumstance, as a wealthy woman and as a woman in her time. Reading her is alawys like laughing with a red hot tear in your eye, for her work is as much an insight into her soul as it is to her lifetime and lifestyle",1

At the heart of The Naked Corporation is the notion that shareholders and other stakeholders are empowered by technology to know more and more about organizations faster and faster, which in turn greatly emboldens them to take action based on their new knowledge.  In other words, perhaps the old adage ""there's one born every minute"" needs updating.  They're still being born, but hopefully now only a few per hour?

I started with Once-a-Month-cooking and at the time it seemed revolutionary, but, though I loved it was a hard days work. Then came Jill Bond and she was really talking bulk cooking! When Deborah's first book came out I was excited because it fit in with my low-on-cash, short-on-time lifestyle. This book is terrific because it provides a healthy alternative that is still pretty inexpensive. The meals are more than casserole and there are lots of options that are more appealing for the warmer weather when you don't want to heat up the kitchen.My favorites are the Cheese and Chicken Shells (not for everyone however) Chicken Enchiladas (taste great made with homemade whole-wheat tortilla, if you do that), Crab rice Chowder (gourmet), Bean Casserole and everyone LOVES Spaghetti Pie. There are lots of good recipes in this book. The drawbacks of this book is that after a few initial sessions I felt that I was more likely to choose some favorites than to use her already laid out sessions...that is okay, but, not as easy as using the shopping lists and plans. Worth trying if you are serious about Freezer Cooking, but I would start with Frozen Assest first",1
"551","Assertiveness Training","As the authors state in the preface of the book, the main focus of the text is to show the reader how to write high quality contracts. This is not a text intended to convince readers of the veracity of design by contract, but if you are a developer with an academic knowledge of assertions, then this book with its extensive examples will likely convert you to a design by contract advocate.Most of the examples presented in the book are written in Eiffel, an object oriented language that fully supports preconditions, postconditions and invariants without need for preprocessing. If you haven't written code in Eiffel I highly recommend that you download EiffelStudio and deploy the examples in this book. Although there are tools that offer assertion facilities, none provide the ease of use as that seen in the Eiffel language. The text covers a preprocessor that imparts assertions to Java, but the extra steps and unique keywords required to incorporate and activate the assertions are likely to prevent wide scale use of the tool in a software development environment.Some aspects of object oriented languages such as design by contract and multiple inheritance are often taught through a language and an integrated developer's environment that minimally supports the functionality. As such developers form a poor opinion of the concept and not the tool. The keyword support of contracts in Eiffel makes the language a perfect learning tool which will impart a more than academic understanding of the value of assertions. The authors state ardently that developers have a choice between spending hours hunting down the causes of runtime errors or instead allocating time to write thorough contracts. As a sometimes Eiffel developer I can state that this assertion is accurate. Since contracts also assign responsibility for the runtime errors, they are invaluable for debugging. I recall an instance when I encountered a postcondition violation while using a linked list from the Eiffel library. As a client of the class, I didn't spend any time tracking down the source of the error other than to report it along with the condition that triggered the error to the supplier. In industry significant time is spent debugging code prior to delivery and maintaining code afterwards. Any concept or tool that aids in this function is indispensable to the project. Apparently many people understood this notion since for several years the proposal to broaden Java to include keyword support of programming by contract was purportedly the most frequent ""non-bug"" report requested by Java developers.The book is well organized providing a set of step by step instructions on how to write robust contracts applicable to a wide range of examples from simple data structures to more advanced cases such as the implementation of the Observer Pattern. I considered myself well versed in design by contract but the six principles and guidelines as well as the frame rules, introduced successively via examples, provided a more rigorous approach to developing contracts than I had employed in the past.In Chapter 2, the distinction between basic and derived queries is discussed and all six principles are introduced through a stack example. Each principle is unveiled in conjunction with designing methods and their contracts for the data structure.In the development of the dictionary class in Chapter 3, the authors present a case for a new query which asks if the dictionary already contains a specific key. The query arises from the specific application of the principles pertaining to postconditions. This is an excellent example of how contracts result in the development of new and needed features in a class. In Chapter 6, the authors present a clear rational for weakening inherited preconditions and strengthening postconditions and invariants in accordance with other literature pertaining to the same topic. In particular, the example of a delivery service reads like a case of retail agreement in plain language but is complemented by examples of code and UML diagrams. The concept of guarding postconditions with preconditions to facilitate possible redefinition of methods is also introduced and well explained.Chapter 8 covers the benefits of design by contract and if the reader has compiled and executed the examples presented in the book, they will have experienced some of these benefits firsthand. Of course there are considerations like better documentation and more reliable code, but the debugging assistance is the most overt benefit of contracts. The stack traces associated with assertion exceptions are an invaluable tool during both development and maintenance. Anyone who has developed quality software under a tight schedule understands the benefits of precision bug identification and resolution.Analysis by contract, introduced in the final chapter, presents the concepts of design by contract abstractly removed from the code specifics. The authors present an analysis of a person withdrawing money from a bank. In doing so they codify the sequence of events based on the contract stating that the design is ""derived from the specification rather than being a design that is also being used as a specification."" The obvious implication of this is that the final product will likely fulfill the specification implicitly.This is a book packed with knowledge that is essential for all developers regardless of the current support of design by contract in conventional languages. In the future, as the more popular languages incorporate additional design by contract concepts, there will be an increased number of authors producing texts on these topics as well as a growing number of developers annotating their resumes accordingly. I suspect that all of these texts will reference Design by Contract by Example and many of the developers that already understand the concept will be well acquainted with the pages of this book.",1

However, all this at talk of a ""just society"" and the ""underprivileged"" can and does mean only one thing:  A POLICE STATE.

"983","Twain's ""before and after"" account of his quarter-century on the Old Muddy","Twain's account of his years on the Mississippi is part travel book, part memoir, and part historical work, with a few sketches, stories, and tall tales tossed in for good measure. There is even an outtake from the not-yet-published ""Huckleberry Finn,"" along with extensive excerpts from historical and contemporary accounts by other authors. This smorgasbord of material makes for an uneven book, but much of it shows Mark Twain at his humorous and humanistic best.The kernel of the volume (and its best, most cohesive section) is in chapters 4 through 17; this material appeared in the Atlantic magazine in 1875 and recalls his early life as a crew member on steamboats in the early 1850s. His adventures as a young man are fraught with danger, full of comedy, populated by a number of ornery, mischievous, and reckless characters, and occasionally embellished (although Twain is a bit obvious when he's fobbing off a yarn). As Twain later wrote in ""Puddn'head Wilson, ""if there was anything better in this world than steamboating, it was the glory to be got by telling about it.""After he published the series in the Atlantic, Twain added another 46 chapters; much of it an account of his homecoming (incognito--or so he'd hoped) to the Mississippi River in 1882, when the steamboat had been rendered obsolete by the railroad. Many of these descriptions are unusually (for Twain) melancholy; he remarks upon the relatively emptiness of the river traffic and notes the transformations to the river and its banks that had made steamboat travel safer but less adventurous. His new journey provides opportunities to relate a number of stories--some allegedly told to him on the river and a few unpublished tales that he deemed relevant and worthy of inclusion.The material from other sources, unfortunately, tends to bog things down--and there are about 10,000 words of it commingled in the text and included as appendices. Twain gathered newspaper articles and historical documents; he also included travel writing from earlier visitors, primarily Europeans distracted by how Americans and their homes were horribly uncouth and dirty. (You almost get the feeling that Twain would have smacked ""the once renowned and vigorously hated"" Frances Trollope upside the head if he'd had the chance; she provides Twain with the most interesting, if snooty, descriptions of traveling along the Mississippi early in the century.)The material Twain wrote, however, more than compensates for the dryness of the extraneous stuff. As always, he is quotable, witty, amusing, and provocative. In spite of its excesses, nobody has done the Mississippi better",1
"753","Another ""I wish I would have read this earlier in life!"" book","Whether you are new to dating, widowed or divorced and starting to date again, or in your 50th year of marriage - you will be able to gleam something from this book that will impact your life in a positive way.Ideally - you could read this book before you embark upon the ""dating chapter"" of your life.  But, even if you're not new to dating, this book can make an amazing and positive impact in many ways - it can increase your chances of finding the right person, reduce your chances of being hurt by or hurting someone (emotionally) during the dating process, and help you avoid scaring away someone with whom, otherwise, you could end up having a wonderful relationship.I especially recommend this to women who are in a relationship (or, who are thinking that they ""thought they were"") with a man who seems to have changed all of a sudden.  If you are questioning things like, where did he go? why didn't he call?  why does he seem so distant now?  what did I do wrong? - you are possibly at a point in the relationship where your choice of actions can make or break a relationship that might just be on the edge of going somewhere.  And, likewise, I recommend this to men who feel that they've come to a point in their relationship where they all of a sudden ""aren't sure"" anymore, are feeling anxious or maybe even ""trapped"", and at the same time there is a strong need to just get away and think and/or if the woman you are dating seems to have become more insecure, worries more, questions you more, starts pressuring you more about commitment, etc.  All of these situations, emotions, etc. are explained in this book.  You're not the only one - it's a normal part of dating - but, unfortunately, most of us won't possibly be able to understand this without someone else pointing it out to us - like Gray has done in this book.Even if you are married - this book opens your eyes to many things and can really improve your level of understanding with your wife/husband.If you are the perfect mate in a perfect relationship - you may not realize some of the problems other people experience and therefore, could probably benefit from this book by being able to better identify with friends, family, children when they come to you for advice",1

"361","Changed my Life","I evolved into a lower carb nutrition by finding first that I needed more protein than I had thought and that I reacted strongly to sugars.  I bought this book when I decided to lose a few pounds, but wanted to understand any health implications related to a low carb diet.  I was already having gall bladder and liver issues.  I bought this book first and 2.5 years later, it is still the best reference I have.  The chapter on hormones is a bit technical, but this chapter alone is worth the price of the book.  Within three days of eliminating grains from my diet, I no longer cared whether or not I lost weight.  My awful blood sugar drops and painful bloating were gone, my energy increased significantly and within weeks I noticed that the gall bladder pain was gone (and it hasn't come back).  Within three months my intense hot flashes disappeared and I started sleeping better.  The book first describes what low carb nutrition is, then goes on to discuss hormones and how insulin impacts the overall balance of the body's hormones in different ways.  It addresses overall energy, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, gastrointestinal disorders, vitamins and minerals, and weight control (one chapter - the rest is on health issues). ",1

"474","Who's telling the truth?","Oh, Spike in San Antonio. It's so hard to believe that sexism exists, isn't it? I'm not sure where your numbers come from, as your logic seems tenuous, at best, but according to that left-wing, liberal think tank known as the US Census Bureau, Rowe-Finkbeiner is right. And it's getting worse. The Census Bureau reported in August, based on the Current Population Survey, that women's  real median earnings fell by $171, or 0.6 percent, from 2002 to 2003, while men's increased by  $336, or 0.8 percent. (The increase for men was not statistically significant, but the decrease for women was.) The gender wage ratio thus fell to 75.5, compared with 76.6 in 2002. In addition, a U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report released in October of 2003, controlling for changes in education and work experience over time, concludes that womens earnings have  remained stagnant, relative to men's, for an even longer period--17 years--with a gap that cannot be explained by measurable differences in education and experience.If you actually read The F-Word, you might find  cited cases like this: Although women make up nearly 3/4 of Wal-Mart's workforce, men hold 90% of management positions--despite female employee's receiving better performance evaluations overall--and female employees are paid lower wages than male employees for the same jobs. None of this is disputed by the corporation. Why? According to Wal-Mart, because men are there for a career, while women are working for pocket money. I wish I could say your attitude was merely naive--but the truth is it's far more dangerous and insidious. Thanks to Rowe-Finbeiner for telling it how it really is.    ",1

"707","Wickid Satire","Fabulously entertaining novel from Martin Amis which easily eclipses the rather depressing `Information.' John Self is a blatantly materialistic hedonist who works as a profitable director of commercials. He is an alcoholic, a misogynist, and a microcosm of mainstream American culture in the 1980's. John has also landed a gig directing a feature film, titled `Good Money,' and `Bad Money,' depending on what day of the week it is. Amis' writing is mordantly brilliant; both acerbic and biting. There are transactions in here that I just love, such as John's stinging interactions with his girlfriend Selina: "" `I've just gone off sex,' said Selina this morning, as she finished the tea I fondly brought her. `So?' I asked her. `God, be nice. Use your imagination. It'll pass. I've just gone off sex.' Then what do you think is the point of you? I wanted to say. But I didn't. I resisted the temptation. I looked into the proud drama of her face, the valves and orbits of her throat, the wetlook runnels of her hair, the breasts, heavier than ever, solidly mounted on the ribcage, the naked slopes of the belly, the sudden flaring of the hips, a smell of sleep. `Then what do you think is the point of you?'`You', she said, `are unreal' (226). You should read Amis for his remarkable power of description, his talent for black comedy and middle-aged disillusionment. Pay little heed to his flights into post-modernity, they are merely exercises in literary chic.",1

"865","Masterpiece of Western fiction.","The Big Sky is not just a masterpiece, it's probably THE masterpiece of the genre of western frontier fiction.  This is unusual because it deals with a moment in time that isn't really dealt with that much - the Rocky Mountain fur trade during its golden age of about 1820 - 1850.  The cowboy era has been responsible for most of western film and literature, partly because the images and events that happen in that world are recognizable to us: the economic and social issues you always see dealt with in ""cowboy"" movies mirror our own experiences in many ways.  The cowboy has also been said to be an image of freedom to Americans, when actually nothing was further from the truth.  Cowboys were regular working stiffs, about as romantic as carpenters or plumbers in their own day.  They didn't consider themselves ""free"", nor would they have spent much time thinking about it during their brutal 14 hour work day.  They did what they did because they loved horses and riding and cattle and it was good honest work that paid a living wage, and there was a bit of swagger to it - people in town recognized cow hands for the tough-as-leather men they were, especially with their characteristic boots and hats and general flair for the dramatic that many had.  But it was backbreaking work, and the entire cowboy heydey lasted less than 30 years.I said all that to say that ""The Big Sky"" really is about freedom, and really is about the West.  It's about the true, wild, primitive west, before the plow, before roads, when there were still huge, intact Indian cultures in place with armies of horsemen and enormous herds of buffalo.  So it's interesting to me that this genre is largely ignored, but I can see why - there are no set-piece plots just begging to be turned into movies - no ""new sherriff in town"" characters, because there are no sherriffs, and no towns other than a few trading posts.  There is only the land and the sky and the interaction between a few incredibly brave white men and all those Indians.If you don't already know, this is the story of Boone Caudill and his friend Jim Deakins, and several important side characters, but it's basically Boone's book.  He's driven west by an aching need for wildness and freedom, and is pushed out by a brutal father.  He makes his way west to St. Louis, along the way befriending Deakins, in hopes of meeting his uncle Zeb who had become a trapper years earlier.  The rest of the tail is complex and interlaced, and not a simplistic good guy/bad guy plot at all, and what stands out is the crystalline depictions of the people and places and over all, arching like the sky itself, is freedom.  Freedom to roam at will in that beautiful country is the main character of this book.  Freedom is the religion, the politics, the philosophy, the recreation - it is everything that is important.  The trappers are there to trap - sure - but they're really there because this is a wild, free place, where they will not be hampered by rules, where they can be natural men.  It sounds over romanticized, but it really did happen that way, and from what we know, that is truly the way they felt about their lives and why they endured the agonies of that existence.  Despairing that new settlers are moving west and building farms and towns, Boone cries ""Lord, Jim - remember the Tetons standing proud in the sun, and the Seeds Ke Dee...don't you remember her when she was all purty and new and not a man track on her save Injun?""  This novel makes you sob like few I've ever read.  The sense of loss, the closing of an age of the world, hangs in the air like mist.  They are going to be the last to see something so precious, and for their pains they get to watch their world wither and die under the press of settlement.The movie ""The Mountain Men"" with Charleton Heston comes close to capturing a tiny bit of this book, and you can tell it's inspired in many ways by it, but no other book or film has ever come close to truly painting the world of the mountain man as has this novel.  ""Jeremiah Johnson"" is another good film, with many fine touches.  But if you want to follow the water up stream, back to its source in the mountains, then please, before you grow too old, read ""The Big Sky"" and open your heart to that time and place and the wild, brazen beauty of the America few Americans know ever existed",1

"719","The best yet, and will be tough to match","The Waste Lands, the third novel in Stephen King's The Dark Tower series is by far the best volume yet.  This volume picks up a short time after the end of Drawing of the Three, and we see Roland training Eddie and Susannah to become true gunslingers in Roland's world.  Soon into the novel, the three gunslingers encounter one the Guardians of Mid-World, a huge cyborg bear, who is guarding a portal that goes between the different worlds.  Roland explains that each of these portals is connected to the Dark Tower by a beam, and if they follow the beam, it will lead them directly to the Dark Tower, they just don't know how far away it is.As the three gunslingers start to follow the beam, we, the readers, are taken to our own world and reintroduced to Jake, the ill-fated child from The Gunslinger.  Jake is currently having a mental breakdown (as is Roland) due to the fact that Roland saved him from dying his destined death at the hands of a Cadillac in The Drawing of the Three.  One part of Jake tells him he should be dead, the other says he should be alive.  Jake's mental breakdown leads him on a journey across New York to a haunted house that has many connections with other characters in the book, and in this house, Jake believes he can get back to Mid-World and be reunited with Roland.The final part of the journey in The Waste Lands, takes our group to a city called Lud, on the outskirts of the waste lands.  The group believes they need to find a monorail named Blaine in the city, and he will help them on their journey to the Dark Tower.  Once they enter the city, much goes wrong and we are introduced to a really cool, but really evil character called the Tick-Tock Man, who runs Lud.  All of this leads up to a ridiculously exciting conclusion and a killer cliffhanger that makes me really glad I waited to read these until they were all published.As far as action and suspense goes, The Waste Lands takes the cake easily from the previous two books.  Most of all, this book makes us appreciate the character development from the previous books.  We care so much about these characters, and would be devastated if anything were to happen to them.  This book also goes a long way in providing some much needed answers about the Dark Tower in general and Mid-World.  These answers are both satisfying and frustrating.  They are satisfying that you aren't completely clueless as to what is going on, but there are deeper answers to everything that we are given in this novel, so it just makes you want to read on more.The series just keeps getting better as it goes along",1

One day Paul gets into an accident and gets both of his legs severely damaged.Coincidently,Guess who finds him? Annie.Yes,she finds him and starts to nurse him back to good health.But when she soon finds out that Paul has killed the character ""Misery"",Annie is pissed...She makes it her business to get Paul to write another novel in which ""Misery"" is not killed.It sounds simple,I know.But when Paul refuses to write the novel,Annie uses force,and she tortures him so much that he just gives in and begins to write a new novel.  Meanwhile thinking of a way to escape,Paul writes the novel and suffers at the same time.He lost one of his foot,because she burnt it off!Yes,this Annie Wilkes is a lunatic.While Paul is under Annie's capture,he learns alot about things he took for granted.The ending of this book is a happy one,you won't be disappointed.I recommend this book as any other SK novel.It is a great Suspense,drama novel...enjoy...NigelHere is another version of the plot.(taken from wikipedia)...""The story begins with Paul Sheldon slowly waking out of a coma. Gradually, his memory returns to him: he is a wildly popular romance novelist of the Misery series of novels (the main character of which is named Misery Chastain) who has crashed his car in a winter storm outside of Silver Creek in Grand County, Colorado, and has been badly injured. His rescuer, Annie Wilkes, is a former registered nurse and has taken him to her secluded country home to personally care for him.As luck would have it, Annie is Paul's ""number one fan"" and eagerly awaited all his publications. Almost immediately however, Paul realizes that there is a flip side to this coin: Annie is mentally ill, she has not told anyone where he is, and she has a violent past that includes a successful career as a serial killer.Annie begins to physically and psychologically abuse Paul when she finishes reading his latest published work, in which the heroine Misery dies. Annie later forces him to burn an unpublished manuscript of his new novel, ""Fast Cars"" he was carrying at the time of his accident, disgusted at its radical departure from the Misery series. Eventually, Annie forces Paul to write a new Misery novel ""just for her"" and bring the character back from the dead. Paul works on the book as Annie's violent mood swings and her psychosis deepens. Her insanity escalates as Paul tries to escape; she eventually chops off one of Paul's feet, one of his thumbs, and murders a police officer investigating his disappearance. As the authorities begin to close in on Annie, Paul's plight--both in his writing and his attempt to save his life--becomes more desperate.Paul eventually defeats Annie by smashing her over the head with the second hand typewriter she had given him to write ""her"" novel. After he escapes, he publishes the new Misery novel to great critical acclaim.""...enjoy...Nigel",1
"194","Still a benchmark","Every now and then a pivotal moment in history is witnessed and recorded by a master communicator.   The mid-first century of Rome was such a time and Tacitus was such a communicator.  The Histories will forever be a benchmark of good history with its observations on human nature and behaviour along with their impact on history.   The historian will do well to read Tacitus not just for the historical lessons but for his approach to history as a record of human activity.   While observing and commenting on the human element in history, Tacitus avoids making moral judgements and remains as objective as possible in the midst of turmoil, wars, and rumors of wars.  His beloved nation and people were suffering under the barbarity of fratricidal war yet he remains above the madness and records the events with passion tempered with objectivity.  His example is one that has remained difficult for others to follow.A word on this translation in particular - I found Mr. Wellesley's translation very readable and poetic.  He seems to have captured the literature value of the text as well as the content.  Well done",1

"13","An Outstanding Resource","I sit here with my two newly acquired volumes of the Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America in absolute awe!  With almost 200 contributors, almost 800 entries and nearly 400 illustrations, editor Andy Smith and Oxford University Press have done a magnificent job of putting together what is clearly the most comprehensive work on this immensely broad subject ever undertaken.  Whether you are a food professional or interested amateur, a historian, sociologist or anthropologist, a student or scholar, these volumes will no doubt become your most important resource for information related in any way to the history of food and drink in America.  The scope is astounding, spanning some five centuries and ranging from events and trends to products, from ethnic, religions and cultural influences to political and social movements in American history, and also includes dozens of biographical entries of important contributors and influences on the development of culinary life and gastronomy in America.  Despite the enormity of this work, it is refreshingly approachable, set forth alphabetically, written in clear language, translated when needed, and annotated and supplemented with bibliographical information for those wishing to explore further.  As a food professional-recipe developer, food writer and culinary educator-there is no doubt in my mind that these pages will soon be worn and this seminal work will remain among my most valued and cherished resources for as long as my interest in food and gastronomy is alive.",1
"137","A nice ride","Once again I am amazed by the amount of controversy associated with a book addressing a religious subject.  I bought this to get a better feel for the Old Testament [operative word is ""feel""].  As a Roman Catholic, the Old Testament is addressed in the first reading at Mass, but then brushed over for the most part in a cursory manner.  It is particularly confusing, hard to read, and difficult to understand in proper context, without some help.  In fact there are portions of the Old Testament that just seem cruel and ridiculous.  Davis's book helps to demonstrate that it was written by people, in a certain time and place, and within a historical milieu.  It may not maintain the historical accuracy some may like, but it is sufficient to be effective.  It is just too simplistic to look to the Bible for all answers; as if it were some sort of statutory code, with the answers to all questions.   The search and answers for truth are never ending, and the Bible is a beginning.  I get more from Catholic writers who explore the Bible and the traditions of my religion relative to our world, than I do from the book itself.  Davis is throwing in his spin, as well as a pretty accurate assessment of the Bible in historical context, which I found quite helpful.  Take it for what is worth, a spin in a convertible through the Bible.  A nice ride, but nothing more. ",1
"780","Great Concept, Best Low Carb Book I have Seen","I bought this book along with Saving Dinner and Saving Dinner for the Holidays last year.I LOVE the concept of having the weekly menu planned out as well as the grocery list put together and ready for shopping. We went through the entire book and I have to say, it really broadened our food horizons as we had been stuck in a rut for a long time with our regular foods. Also, the books really did eliminate a lot of stress by allowing me to know in advance ""What's for dinner"" and be ready to prepare it.The only cons I can think of would be that the food is not exactly kid friendly, and you will need to be an open minded eater. If you have a lot of people with finicky preferences in your household, this may not be the book for you. Also, our grocery bill for two went up from about $75 a week to $125 because of the veggies and meats. Good, healthy quality food ingredients, but unfortunately, painful to the wallet.That said, I have NEVER seen a low carb book out there that compares to this one, the food is good, the variety is there, and it takes the low carb lifestyle above and beyond ""bunless burgers"" and eggs and bacon.Overall, I would recommend Leanne's Saving Dinner books. For the open minded foodie. Or for those weeks that you just want to not worry about dinner and the grocery list. These books are great to have and do offer a good variety of recipes to broaden horizons while removing some stress",1
"355","Excellent classic book on toxic shame and how to deal with it","This is in my opinion John Bradshaw's best book. It encapsulates his thinking on the area of toxic shame and demonstrates how this phenomenon is at the core of compulsions, addictions, co-dependencies and our need to achieve beyond what is really necessary or serves our larger purposes.In this volume, John Bradshaw demonstrates how toxic shame develops and leads to the breakdown of families. He also talks about how this cycle is perpetuated through generations and actually covers a lot of ground in terms of family dynamics.Through affirmations, working with feelings, visualizations and other techniques, the author shows the reader how to work through toxic shame. As someone who has done the work himself, he comes across as compassionate, knowledgeable and very practical.Sometimes I get annoyed when I read this book because of unnecessary repetition of some key concepts. This is the explanation for my 4 rating, along with the fact that many of his books overlap each other with respect to content. Therefore, my overall rating is that this is a solid, well-written classic that certainly deserves its best-seller status. However, prepare yourself for some repetition and unnecessarily long examples of what he is talking about.",1
"850","An Inspiration and a Joy","I am a photographer and a writer and the author of numerous books on photography and I have had a copy of the Sierra Club Engagement Calendar on my desk every day for more than 20 years. I find this calendar to be an inspiration in terms of both its beautiful photography and its wonderful geographic diversity. I've never had a photo published in the Engagement book, but I've probably gathered more inspiration and ideas from these little calendars than from the hundreds of how-to books in my office. The photos in these engagement calendars are the cream of the cream of the crop of the world's best nature photography. Master photographers like the late Galen Rowell, who had many dozens of photos published here, consider it one of their finest showcases--and who can blame them. Sierra Club has never relented on the quality of the reproduction of these superb datebooks and considering there are more than 50 photos in each book, the price is a bargain.  I have used this calendar as a journal and a diary of my writing progress for, literally, decades. And whenever my brain starts to freeze after writing about photography for weeks on end and I need a new idea to write about, I simply flip through the calendars and I can discover hundreds of them in the work of many of the greatest modern nature-photography masters. Also, when I'm looking for travel ideas, places to go to shoot new pictures for my books, I also look here for inspiration and ideas. The Mojave Desert, Monument Valley, the Everglades, the Sonoran desert--these are all places that I learned about in great detail from these datebooks. You learn more about a place by seeing great photos of it than you ever will by reading about it--or so I feel. (Of course, you learn a great deal more if you hop on an plane and go see it!)Finally, I gave my mother the engangement calendar for Christmas every year for around 20 years and she used them as a daily journal. I still have every one of those journals and they are a great joy to flip through and see what she was up to each day. Why this long winded (and very sincere!) endorsement for such a simple product? Because I owe these caldendars (and the Sierra Club) a debt of gratitude for inspiring me day after day, year after year, with the greatest photography in the world. If you have a young photographer in your life, inspire them, show them how spectacular photographs of the natural world can be. For an investment of under $15 you can change their perceptions of nature and help educate them about fine photography. Someone gave me my first copy of this calendar many years ago and I've been grateful ever since. Of course, I have to warn you, once you look at some of these photos you'll want to put your camera up on Ebay :)  But don't do it! Instead, use these photos as your photographic inspiration and your goal.   Jeff WignallAuthor, The Joy of Digital Photography (Lark Books",1

"791","Why Classics are Classics","As one reads Peter Pan, one doesn't have to do much thinking to figure out why its story has achieved such worldwide acclaim.  I had ridiculously high expectations of Mr. Barrie's imagination before purchasing this title, and he has fulfilled them completely.Many parts of the story are nothing but nonsense, which I enjoy above all else.  Mr. Darling, the head of the Darling family, commands his children to take their medicine after he hides the medicine he's supposed to take.  He brags about how noble he is for drinking a medicine that tastes so much worse that theirs.  Unfortunately for him, during his bragging his medicine is found, and the whole family agrees to take their respective medicines on the count of three.  Sure enough, when three is reached, everyone except Mr. Darling takes their medicine, and Mr. Darling once again tries to hide his.This kind of scenario is what I'd call Mark Twain nonsense.  You can imagine it being true, even though it's quite high up on the ridiculous scale.  Then there's what I would classify as over-the-top nonsense - AKA bull - which there is plenty of in Barrie's original story of Peter Pan.  Going back to Mr. Darling, if we take a look at how he's doing near the end of the book, we find him going to and from work in a dog kennel.  Ah, yes...grown men in pet taxis.  What could be more fun than the ""he-didn't-even-try-to-make-this-belivable"" silliness of such a scene?  To be honest, I don't know if I'd even read books if they all left out fun stuff like this.Other silly parts of the book involve Wendy growing up a day quicker than most girls; the narrator claiming he hates Mrs. Darling only to call her his favorite character a few sentences later; the lost boys asking Wendy to change the characters her story just two sentences into it; the narrator using the phrase ""woke into life"" because Peter likes the word ""woke"" more than ""wakened;"" and my favorite, Captain Hook using a stale cake as a missle and then falling over it in the dark.I believe the novel version of Peter Pan was written after the author had already established Peter Pan as a successful play.  That may explain a lot about the colorful narration, which takes many, many literary liberties.  We see everything from blatant narrator interference with the characters in the story to the shameless attempt at informing the audience that the narrator only chooses to make the events in the story happen a certain way so certain characters in the book won't be disappointed.  Perhaps without these wacky (and maybe even insane) traits in the narration, there'd be no reason to read the book, since it would be no different from the play.  After reading the Peter Pan novel though, I'd have to say it almost seems criminal to watch an adaptation of Peter Pan without any wacky narration.Contrary to most adaptations of Peter Pan, the individual lost boys (of where there are six I believe) are actually more developed as characters than John or Michael Darling.  Heck, at the end of the book they actually end up moving out of the Neverland to live with the Darlings and grow up to busy themselves in interesting professions.I may not like the actual land of Neverland as much as I like the land of Oz, but Barrie's narration is unbeatable in my opinion.  He could probably make a Jeopardy contestant's Friday night schedule sound exciting.I believe Barrie has written another Peter Pan book as well, a prequel of sorts entitled ""Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens.""  It should be interesting, particuarly if it addresses what is contained in the dark dreams that haunt Peter throughout this book.  Freud would have a field day with such dreams and the whole mother issue.The only thing I expected to see in this book that I didn't see was ""happy thoughts.""  That must have been a creation of Disney",1
"62","Excellent Idea, Severe Omission","Blanchard and Hybels and Hodges team up for an excellent perspective on leadership from a Christian point of view. While reaching out to the secular marketplace with valid concepts for servant leadership, they put together an excellent framework for leadership. The summary checklist, given on pp. 171ff., offer a helpful concise summary of the book. The glaring omission, and one that I can't believe that Hybels would make, is to clearly point out that following Jesus' style of leadership is absolutely impossible apart from first having a personal relationship with Jesus, in other words, you can't lead like Jesus if you don't have him in your life to help you. I can't believe that there wasn't at least an appendix for those who would like to pursue that issue further. I believe that the authors are posturing too much to get the secular audience to read the book. But for the Christian, it is an excellent book",1
"902","The Struggle for Revolutionary Culture  ","Trotsky once wrote that of the three great tragedies in life- hunger, sex and death- revolutionary Marxism, which was the driving force behind his life and work, mainly concerned itself with the struggle against hunger. That observation contains an essential truth about the central thrust of the Marxist tradition. However, as Trotsky demonstrates here, Marxist methodology cannot and should not be reduced to an analysis of and prescription for that single struggle. Here Trotsky takes on an aspect of the struggle for mass cultural development.In a healthy post-capitalist society mass cultural development would be greatly expanded and encouraged. If the task of socialism were merely to vastly expand economic equality, in a sense, it would be a relativity simple task for a healthy socialist society in concert with other like-minded societies to provide general economic equality with a little tweaking after vanquishing the capitalism mode of production. What Marxism aimed for, and Trotsky defends here, is a prospect that with the end of class society and economic and social injustice the capacity of individual human beings to reach new heights of intellectual and creative development would flourish. That is the thought that underpins Trotsky's work here as he analyzes various trends in Russian literature in the immediate aftermath of the October Revolution of 1917. In short, Marxism is certainly not a method to be followed in order to write great literature but it does allow one to set that literature in its social context and interrelatedness. You will find no Deconstructionist or other fashionable literary criticism here. Quite the contrary. Here Trotsky uses his finely tuned skill as a Marxist to great effect as he analyzes the various trends of literature as they were affected (or not affected) by the October Revolution and sniffs out what in false in some of the literary trends. Mainly at the time of writing the jury was still out about the prospects of many of these trends. He analyzes many of the trends that became important later in the century in world literature, like futurism and constructivism, and others- some of which have disappeared and some of which still survive. The most important and lasting polemic which Trotsky raised here, however, was the fight against the proponents of `proletarian culture'. The argument put forth by this trend maintained that since the Soviet Union was a workers state those who wrote about working class themes or were workers themselves should in the interest of cultural development be given special status and encouragement (read a monopoly on the literary front).  Trotsky makes short shrift of this argument by noting that, in theory at least as its turned out, the proletarian state was only a transitional state and therefore no lasting `proletarian culture' would have time to develop. Although history did not turn out to prove Trotsky correct the polemic is still relevant to any theory of mass cultural development.One of the results of the publication of this book is that many intellectuals, particularly Western intellectuals, based some of their sympathy for Trotsky the man and fallen hero on his literary analysis and his ability to write. This was particularly true during the 1930's here in America where those who were anti-Stalinist but were repelled by the vacuity of the Socialist Party were drawn to him. A few, like James T. Farrell (Studs Lonigan trilogy), did this mostly honorably. Most, like Dwight MacDonald and Sidney Hooks, etc. did not and simply used that temporary sympathy as a way station on their way to anti-Communism. Such is the nature of the political struggle.A note for the politically- inclined who read this book. Trotsky wrote this book in 1923-24 at the time of Lenin's death and later while the struggle for succession by Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev was in full swing. While Trotsky did not recognize it until later (nor did others, for that matter) this period represented the closing of the rising tide of the revolution. Hereafter, the people who ruled the Soviet Union, the purposes for which they ruled and the manner in which they ruled changed dramatically. In short, Thermidor in the classical French revolutionary expression was victorious. Given his political position why the hell was he writing a book on literary trends in post-revolutionary society at that time.       ",1

Bioinformatics is a new field, and this book has delivered a useful introduction to it without recourse to expensive textbooks full of unreadable filler",1
"993","And the lesson is...","Always think twice. Never jump to hasty conclusions without considering ALL the effects of an act or decision. That's the essence of Economics: ""looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy."" Most economic fallacies are the result of ignoring this lesson, as Henry Hazlitt clearly shows with many examples throughout this witty short book. Are there benefits in destruction (let it be a humble broken window or a bloody war? Is government spending the solution to unemployment or industries in trouble? Can taxes benefit the economy of a country? Do inflationary policies really encourage a well-functioning economy or are they just a smokescreen to conceal otherwise unpopular decisions? Are all labor union practices truly justified? And, what about tariffs, subsidies, parity prices, rent control, or minimum wage laws? These are the kind of issues the author analyses beyond what you can usually hear, read, or see on the media.Beyond what you may think about the government's role in the economy, whether you agree or not with the author's liberal views, ""Economics in One Lesson"" shows how one should always try to see beyond the obvious and avoid missing the forest for the trees.As the author points out, half-truths presented as complete truths are behind most economic fallacies. Demagogues and 'rogue' economists try to divert our attention by focusing only on the most visible effects of a given decision (or, in the worst cases, on the only effects that should be seen not to discredit an already decided course of action). Learning to supplement and correct their half-truths with the other half is the most reasonable thing an independent thinker can do. BTW, ""Economics in One Lesson"" might be a good place to start..",1
"108","nifty development environment","The use of an Integrated Development Environment [IDE] for a user to learn a language in, and to then program within, is well known. Microsoft has made powerful IDEs for its languages. And the open source Eclipse can be used for Java. Along these lines, Ducasse offers his book. It teaches Smalltalk using the Squeak IDE. The twist is that Squeak uses the visual metaphors of robots and robot factory, to convey the crucial concepts of objects/classes. As Ducasse explains, Squeak can be directed at an audience that is perhaps of high school age or even younger. So a clear visual feedback between example code and what the student sees then happen is vital, given her limited background and possibly limited attention span. Squeak uses Smalltalk in part because that is a very minimalist language. If you come from C++, Java or C#, you may be struck by its simplicity, compared to the oodles of classes and notational intricacies of those languages. Which of course also makes it easier for a young student to learn Smalltalk or Squeak itself.I wonder a little about the book itself, though. A motivated high school student could easily use it. But for some younger students? In that situation, it may well be that the book could be best directed at a teacher, who can then instruct from it",1

This cookbook is the one I use over and over again.  I have cooked almost every recipe in the book, more than once, which is a true testament to a wonderful cookbook.The beauty of it is that is is simple -- most ingredients are things you would have on-hand.

"544","Fasten Your Seatbelts and Enjoy the Ride!","     I stumbled upon Matthew Reilly's novel in the new release section of my public library. I had never heard of him before, this being his first release in the United States, but the synopsis on the inside of the dust jacket caught my attention so I decided to give the book a try.       Most books coming out now have author blurbs of recommendation I take with a grain of salt. Most of these authors are paid for their reviews or they are personnal friends, making it difficult to determine the sincerity of the review.  Everything is promised to be a ""white, knuckle thriller"" or my personal favorite ""a rollercoaster ride of excitement"" but the majority of the time the book does not live up to the hype. This is definately not the case with ""Ice Station"". This book is Action with a capital A! How this book has not been optioned for film bewilders me because if it is done right it would be one of the best action films of the past twenty years. The book alone left me exhausted.     For a quick intro without giving anything away (because I hate spoilers) a crisis emerges at an isolated Antarctic research station.  A marine recon team is sent to investigate and all hell breaks loose.  This is not an exaggeration.  When the action begins in this book it does not let up. Every time I thought the book was going to have a down moment to give me the opportunity to eat or get some sleep, I got cold cocked by a left hook.  The characters only pause in the book to reload.     Now there will be nay sayers out there who will criticize that the book lacks any real substance.  Maybe there could have been more characterization, perhaps there is a fact or two off when utilizing military jargon or technology, or maybe an event bends the laws of probability but all I can say is I don't care. I had fun with this book. For the two days I read the book I had a blast. This is not a contender for the pulitzer prize. It is not going to pop up on Oprah's book club. This is a summer action movie put to words and I dare you not to have fun.

"22","A dream, a vision, the West incarnate","Reading this book is like having a holy vision: I feel as if I should tell the world about it, but at the same time it seems so sacred and personal that maybe I should just keep it to myself and try to figure out why it came to me, into my life, into my head.The book is the story of Billy Parham, a son in a late-1930s New Mexican ranching family.  Billy traps a wolf that has been killing his father's cattle but realizes he can't kill it and has to return it to its home in the mountains of old Mexico.  Billy crosses the border into Mexico, and as he does he crosses from real life into a world of dreams, where everyone moves as if the air was liquid, where every ruin has an irretrievable story, where soot and heat and danger hang in the air, and where nothing ever goes as planned.The story is not as streamlined or as focused as its thematic predecessor, ""All the Pretty Horses,"" but that's not necessarily a shortcoming.   The book sprawls out like a wide hot desert--curling north and south, east and west, across the present and into the past.  The writing is as good as any writing I've ever read ever, and certain metaphors and feelings will stay with you for years.  For example: the coals of a campfire seeming like an exposed piece of the core of the earth.This is a book that needs to be read.  Pick it up, and let it seep into your skin, let it open you to other worlds and peoples and ideas, and let it change you.  Let it open your eyes to the world, and to the West, and the goodness and the hope and the sadness that haunts the lives of all of us.  This is a book made of all those ineffable things that most of us just can't put into words.  But here, somehow, Cormac McCarthy has managed to do just that.  Here is the intangible, but tangible.  Here is the unnameable, but named.  Here are the thoughts you could never express, expressed.",1

"92","Excellent narrative of Billy Beane and his bean counter approach","               Lewis has written a fascinating study of the bean counter approach ,used by Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics to construct a team of moderately priced players chosen on the basis of ,primarily, on base percentage for everyday players and the number of groundball outs and strikeouts for selecting pitchers.             This approach generated a number of divisional championships for Oakland in the weakest American League division,but no pennants and world championships.There are omitted variables and misspecification  problems in the sabermetrics(statistics) approach of Bill James used by Beane.First,James's system totally ignores the number of batter strikeouts.All outs are not equal.Hitting flyouts and groundball outs will many times advance the baserunner if any previous batters got on base.Hitting the ball also allows the baserunner to get on on an error.Strikeouts are thus the worst type of out.This omitted variables problem can be dealt with by simply deducting 1  to 1.25 points from the on base percentage for every strikeout over,say,100 for a regular,everyday player who gets 600 official at bats over the course of the season.The second problem is that the James system does not differentiate between walks due to the hitting skill of the batter and walks used by the pitcher to set up forceplays and double plays,especially if he is a pitcher who gets a lot of ground ball outs.Another category is needed-walks that are not followed by forceouts or double play groundouts and/or walks where the runner is able to steal second base.These walks are different from the walks given to a 40 homer player who strikes out 150+ times a year and hits .250 but has a .375 OBP.        James's system needs to be adjusted to take into account these two factors",1

His relationship with his fast growing up daughter Sheridan is not what it once was and his new boss is doing everything he can to make Joe's life a misery.  Throw in a civil war between Saddlestring's largest family and the appearance of, after along term behind bars bloodthirsty J. W. Keeley, who will not stop at anything until he has avenged his daughter's (Joe's stepdaughter's) death through the slow and torturous murder of Joe Pickett, and one way or another the era of Saddlestring's game warden is set to end.  C.J. Box's Joe Pickett adventures seem to very in style with each novel.  The initial Open Season was a surreal not quite but almost Carl Hiaasen type novel, then Savage Run turned the series into a more traditional thriller type of adventure.  Trophy Hunt introduced a very far fetched paranormal element into the series and as many, I was glad when Out of Range returned this series to the traditional believable realistic type thriller, a style which continues with In Plain Sight.  I would strongly suggest reading these books in order, starting with Open Season as parts of previous novels are given away in subsequent ones and In Plain Sight is certainly no exception to that.  It will be interesting to see if C.J. Box continues with the characters of this series in some form or another or if his next book will be a totally different kind of adventure.    ",1

"762","Bittersweet Humor and Advice to a Young Son","You probably know Joel Siegel from his enthusiastic movie reviews on Good Morning America.  But do you know the rest of the story?  Here's a chance to find out.Mr. Siegel became a father for the first time at age 54, and his son, Dylan, was born on the day Mr. Siegel finished chemotherapy for colorectal cancer.  That cancer later spread to his lungs, and two more cancer surgeries and treatments followed.  Mr. Siegel's marriage did not last, but his love for Dylan did.  Realizing that his chances of living to see Dylan grow up are limited, Mr. Siegel decided to write down all of the wonderful things he wanted to share with Dylan over the next few decades . . . but might not be able to.  The result is a touching memoir with a heart that will cause you to shed more than an occasional tear while appreciating Mr. Siegel's love for his son.Mr. Siegel writes well, has had many interesting experiences, and retains his sense of wonder.  He is open about many of his faults (which have led to failed marriages), but remains cautiously optimistic . . . and careful.Dedicating the material to his son makes the memoir more personal and meaningful than almost any other memoir that I have read.  Anyone with an open heart would enjoy and benefit from this book.If you are like me, you expected to mainly hear about the movies . . . and you will.  But there's much more in the book about Mr. Siegel's family, Jewish heritage (there's even a Yiddish dictionary with hilarious definitions), illnesses, past marriages, and advice for Dylan.  The show business stories are almost all ones that I had not heard before, and will reward those who are primarily looking for this feature.  Although you might think these are only about the movies, he also was a music critic and got to know the Beatles in the early days.I was particularly interested by Mr. Siegel's first-hand accounts of working for civil rights in the South, helping with Bobbie Kennedy's campaign, and how he helped his wife, Jane, with her fatal illness.  One of the thoughts you will have as you read this book is how you would write a parallel one for either your children or your grandchildren to play the same role in sharing knowledge and love across the generations.  I hope you will read this book and feel inspired to either transmit your own lessons in your own way . . . or to create the book you want to share with your descendants.  In any case, keep a hanky handy!",1

"590","The temporary death of a priori","Before the Epiricist philosophers came along, it was generally accepted that there were certain things that humans merely knew facts to be true. Basic philosophical concepts were reasoned to be true by a priori reasoning. Thus, complex metaphysical ideas were formed by inductive logic, working off what was assumed to be true. Then Hume came along and destroyed more than two thousand years of metaphysics. Hume showed that everything we know can be broken down in to two categories: Relations of Ideas and Matters of Fact. Relations of Ideas are things that a true by defintion. 2+2 will always equal 4, because that is how it is defined. Try as we might, we can never successfully imagine 2+2 equalling 5. So relations of facts do not really tell us anything about the natural world. They are definitions we use to describe what is happening. Matters of fact, on the other hand, are ideas we have that arise from our experience with the world, such as ""The Sun will rise tomorrow morning."" Unlike with Relations of Ideas, Matters of Fact are not true my their defintition. We can imagine successfully ""The Sun will not rise tomorrow."" How, then, if we can imagine the supposed impossible, do we know anything to be truly impossible? Hume creates the basis for philosophical skepticism in this enquiry. He effectively show us that we can never know anything to be absolutely true. It wasn't until Kant's Critique of Pure Reason that philosophy recovered from the blow of Hume's metaphysics. This is a seminal text in the history of metaphysical and epistimilogical work and should be read by any and all philosophers",1

Obviously this is a book that will appeal most to people who are already Elizabeth Bishop fans. This is more of a work in process. It tells more about her as a person, it illustrates the great effort she went to get her poems just right before sending them off for publication. It shows something of the way her mind worked. The work here is not Ms. Bishop's best. It's unfinished. Some of the shorter pieces, fragments really, make you wonder where she might have taken it.",1
"239","Amazing book!","What lessons, if any, do past social movements teach American citizens?  Is change feasible in today's society?  Howard Zinn attempts to answer these two questions, along with a number of others, in his book entitled 'You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train: A Personal History of Our Times.'  A beautifully written and inspirational book, 'You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train' is quintessential Zinn-direct, yet optimistic.  Zinn's central argument is that we are all capable of participating in change, however, for change to occur, we must all experience a social and political reawakening.  Zinn's book offers the reader a more hopeful version of politics and society.  Yet, such a version is only feasible if we, as Americans, actively participate in the political process.  This involvement will fill ones soul with a sense of meaning, and in the end will create a better world for all to live in.  For those interested in the history of American society, politics, and social justice issues, 'You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train' is a marvelous book filled with inspiration",1
"567","Good History Book, Bad Science Reference","Bishop presents an entertaining history of bees and beekeeping, and gives us an absolutely fascinting tour into the relationship between humans and bees, both ancient and modern. What she misses are her science references:On page 142, Bishop recounts the removal of a stinger: ""...he grabbed the whole sac, which simply squeezed in more venom."" This is not true. It is an oft-repeated piece of conventional wisdom, but in 1996, entomologists at UC Riverside published an article in The Lancet (348:301-302), with the conclusion that rather than removal method, speed is of the essence. Visscher and Vetter wrote of their conclusion: ""The method of removal is irrelevant, but even slight delays in removal caused by concerns over performing it correctly (or getting out a knife blade or credit card) are likely to increase the dose of venom received. The advice should be changed to simply emphasize that the sting should be removed, and as quickly as possible."" On page 276, Bishop writes about royal jelly ""...worker bees secrete and feed exclusively to a select few fertilized eggs, one of which, on this special diet, will grow into a queen.""  This is patently incorrect. Royal jelly, as all beekeepers know, is fed to all the brood by nursery bees for the first 2-3 days of the brood's development. After this time, most brood who are not destined to be queens will receive pollen as food, whereas queens are fed the jelly all their lives. It is rather stunning that an author who keeps bees herself and obviouly spent considerable efforts in researching her book can make such a glaring error in bee knowledge. This was quite a blow to me at this point in the book as I have enjoyed the book very much, and to run into such a blatantly uninformed statement from the author caused me major disappointment.

The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon is a complex mixture of simple things. The simplicity of the language, style, ideas, characters and concepts is unique to this book. The expression of complicated life matters and situations in such a simple manner makes this book a definite must-have.In the book, Mark Haddon borrows the voice of his lead character Christopher, an autistic child, to tell the story. Christopher is an autistic and smart 15 year old boy. He's a math whiz with an unsatisfiable appetite to solve problems. His approach to all life issues is to convert them into a math problem of some sort and find out ways to deal with these issues.The story mainly revolves around Christopher's investigation to find out who killed his neighbour's dog Wellington. Despite his father's instructions to not pursue the issue, Christopher goes on to attempt to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington.The story unravels before Christopher and he is hit with a reality far more complex than his own understanding of life. His investigations result in only unearthing long buried secrets of his mother who, he knows, died three years earlier.Christopher's determination to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington and the mystery of his mother's death is something to be revered throughout the development of the story. The child's emotional roller coaster ride is witnessed first hand on every page. The reader experiences Christopher's feelings and emotions so transparently that it makes it extremely difficult not to feel attached to the story.The story in itself is funny at times, sad and miserable at others; complex in one place and extremely simple in another.This is a novel that you can be certain will change the way you perceive the things in your life once you are through. Your world will never be the same again. In a good way",1

"11","A great find during an annual summer shopping trip","I found this novel at a bookstore on the boardwalk I visit at least once every summer.  I love going there and looking to see if I can find a book that I have never heard of, by an author I've never heard of, and buy it on a whim.  This is the novel I bought last year.  I has, unfortunately, sat on my shelf since then until tonight, because of many reasons.  Tonight, however, I picked it up and read it cover to cover.  The narrative was brilliantly told, the dialogue completely believable and the plot totally heartwrenching.  If I had made it to the end without some tears, I would believe myself made of stone!  Skip is a character many can relate to: a man unsatisfied with how his life has turned out, down about how his friends have really not been friends at all, that gets the chance to do something great by this little child.  However, it is the change she makes in those around her which are truly the BLESSINGS of the title.  Faith, a name not used lightly, restores her namesake in all those touched by her.  She ultimately gives him the chance  of making something of his life without even knowing it.  Many BLESSINGS occur in this wonderful novel, and I found myself all at once sour about how humankind can be at times, but also proud at how humankind can be at others (which is a fact, in itself, that proves how well Quindlen has spun her tale).  The fact is that just because a person has been to jail, has deadbeat friends, does not mean he is of that same stock; just because an elderly woman has become so dragged down by her own life does not mean she has no feeling left in her.  Skip, Lydia, Nadine, Meredith, Jennifer...all have many dimentions to their characters that Quindlen has spectacularly drawn",1
"37","Retro yet relevant","Whilst the book may seem a little dated when it talks of tweed in the country and a matching silk jacket for your cocktail dress, it does contain a lot of useful information about putting together a great career wardrobe on a budget, which colours match, which accessories never date, and how to dress for evening functions of any nature.I highly recommend it for anyone who thinks Jackie Kennedy was the epitome of chic, and who would like to know how to pull it off themselves",1

"495","The importance of character in an age of image","Os Guinness has a knack for taking difficult and complex subjects and capturing and presenting information that allows small chunks of the philosophy to be grasped and pondered deeply.  This book is no exception.  The fact that it is also a study guide is even more effective in delivering the message while directing the reader to several key questions to consider in each section. One of the best aspects of the book are the hundreds of quotes and essays, all around the central theme of the importance of character.  While our culture often acts to create an ""end justifies the means"" behavioral set, never before has character been so important, or so difficult to really practice and live.The book begins with some essays from famous leaders; from Plato to George Washington, Winston Churchill to Machiavelli, and compares and contrasts what each felt about the importance of character, and how it was to be demonstrated.  Much of the material is pretty well known, yet the ability to so easily read and discuss different styles and approaches is well worth the effort. My favorite sections were on the ""Cultural Erosions of Character"" in which the many examples of how society pushes and changes the definition and meaning in life impacts what we define as important at all.  From advertising, to media, the pressure to conform is greater than ever, but in some ways has always existed.  One of the best essay's in my opinion is called the ""Revenge of Failure"" wherein Henry Fairlie rips the ""legend of our times"", as envy at its worst.  No longer content to envy what others have and we do not, we now attempt to destroy in others that which we cannot achieve ourselves.  This process degrades talent and is a poor attempt to ""buy"" our way into importance not through the achievement of something remarkable, but through the tearing down of the remarkable achievement into something attainable.  Thus character becomes something that is no longer ""earned"".The sections on plastic surgery and other shifts into a looks based culture further erode the importance of character.  In this relentless and obsessed pursuit of the elusive perfection, the hunter becomes the hunted, and always loses in the battle to fight against aging and the myth of happiness in ones physical appearance.   Powerful depictions of how this societal pressure has claimed far too many who sacrifice character for fleeting and shallow appearance, are depicted with a convicting clarity.Overall, this is a very well done and thought provoking book.  As a study guide it would be ideal for small groups, or even personal reflections.  The book is so full of quotes and essays that it can be read at once, or in dozens of small bites with equal effectiveness.  Highly recommended.",1

"165","Buy 10 Copies of This Book!","I have bought many books in my life, but Randy Gage's ""Why You're Dumb, Sick and Broke"" is the first time I ever bought a book with a parental advisory warning for explicit language. Gage does things a little differently than anyone else, which is something I quickly discovered when reading this book. This book is brash, to the point and filled with insight and inspiration. I thought that Gage presented his points in a well thought out manner that really took the establishment on head on.Many points presented in the book are in other personal development books. However, I don't know of any book that has all these points in one book. Even Gage himself admits in an interview that this is a combination of Think and Grow Rich, The Secret, Ayn Rand and several other books and cd's.A lot of it you have heard before, like if you say you are broke, then you will always be broke. However, I didn't realize how much the mainstream media and the political establishment are contributing to our negative, broke thoughts. Most frightening of all, I learned why the establishment needs us to be broke in order to keep their power. I am taking Randy's lead and watching less TV, especially the news. That's the worst of all!There is also a nice introduction to Libertarianism and the works of Ayn Rand. As a Libertarian myself, I was delighted to see this included in the book. With recent reports circulating about Britain on the verge of becoming a police state, this warning about big government couldn't have come at a more appropriate time.As expected, Randy does make a plug for MLM, but this is by no means an MLM book. The MLM plug is just a few short pages. However, it is still a nice resource for MLM people to use for third party credibility. He also mentioned real estate and information marketing as good businesses as well. I must be smart, healthy and rich, as I am already involved in all three.I found myself nodding in agreement to this book. I also found a lot of places where I was thinking, ""Oh, I'm not the only one who this this way. Why hasn't this been mentioned before in the press?"" Other times, I thought, ""Oh my god, I am being really manipulated here."" While he was ""preaching to the choir"" with me, I'm sure that many people with more ""mainstream"" views will feel more challenged reading this book.Bottom line, if you love MLM get 10 copies of this book, if you support the Libertarians, get 10 copies of this book. If you are like me and love them both, get 25 copies.About the authorCarlos Scarpero is the host of the Network Marketing Minute podcast and the creator of the Success Duplicator downline building system.

"277","This guy can write!","I picked up this paperback because my curiosity was stimulated by watching Mystic River, the film based on another LeHane novel. Darkness, Take My Hand did not disappoint. Different characters, same setting, and identical sense of insanity and irredeemable evil. LeHane's prose is intelligent and witty without being overbearing, a welcome change from many other authors who crank out formulaic , hackneyed language and stories in the crime genre. LeHane's descriptions jump right off the page at you. His characters are so human, so intense, their dialogue so sharp, that it's almost like watching a movie in your mind. There isn't a wasted word in this book. The suspense starts to build on page 1, and never lets up, becoming more and more menacing with each subsequent chapter. This is a stay-up-late read to finish only when you're NOT alone in the night. LeHane's other works top my summer reading list. I'd love to see what he could do in a different genre",1
"788","Undecided","I liked TRACK OF THE CAT, but I didn't love it. The idea that the lion is wrongly accused was one I found appealing, but the plot was, at times, predictable. The setting was well-drawn, but most of the characters were pretty one-dimensional. The clincher, though, is that I'm not sure yet just how captivating Anna Pigeon is as a main character. I believe that this is her first story, so I don't want to make a snap judgement, but Anna is nowhere near as quirkily entertaining as a Sherlock Holmes or Miss Marple. That would be expecting a lot, I know, but frankly she isn't even as engaging as, say, Gideon Oliver or Sharon McCone or Brother Cadfael, and she lacks the depth and power of a Harry Bosch.As I said, the jury is still out for me here. I liked TRACK OF THE CAT, but I wasn't wild about it. It's a solid first try, and I'll certainly read another Anna Pigeon or two before deciding whether or not to go for the whole series. I expect most readers will find this opening mystery enjoyable. I recommend it, but my recommendation is a mild one",1

The sauces for Halibut with Spicy Asian Vinaigrette (really a sambal vinaigrette) and Wasabi Cream were awesome.  Veggie dishes like Asparagus with Shallot and sesame seeds add a special touch to everyday dinners.  Granted, I haven't even put a dent in the vast amount of dishes represented in this massive cookbook - but so far so good!  I picked this up a few months agao as a remainder and paid about 10.00 for it - about a penny a recipe!  What a deal",1

"401","A good summer read!","Kate White introduces us to the world of tabloid reporting in a sassy titillating crime novel--Over Her Dead Body. I could feel the slime drip off the characters that were responsible for keeping the Buzz and its rag competitors in production. While the mention of 'current' celebrities will date this book, Kate's spellbinding storytelling definitely has staying power. Over Her Dead Body is a fast-paced novel about the murder of the Mona Hodges, Editor in Chief of the Buzz, who had a long list of hostages in her wake, each one having good reason to hate her or perhaps kill her-with a sprinkling of romance for levity. Even though the main character, Bailey Weggins, a celebrity crime writer, gets discombobulated many times throughout the investigation, she is clever enough to pull together the pieces of the mystery to its conclusion. Right to the end Kate White keeps the reader guessing on who did this horrible crime. I am looking forward to reading more Bailey Weggins' mysteries.

There are some very touching passages that get to the heart of what a good marriage is and the unique bond that husband and wife share. I am glad this story wasn't about finding new love soon after losing someone who was clearly her best friend and soul mate. For the most part it is about finding other areas of pleasure in your life through exploring different types of bonds with friends old and new. It is also about new beginnings while still honoring the memory of the one she's lost. I could read this novel over and over. The deep respect for marriage is refreshing in a world that can be dismissive of marriage's sanctity and too often focused on those that fail",1

The book left me such respect for the depths that Ruth Reichl went through in order to dine as the everyday person would experience, especially in NYC's ""best"" restaurants.  Her recounts made me actually appreciate the research and dedication required to write a truly objective (as objective as food tastes get, I suppose) review.  A very easy and enjoyable read.",1
"457","Freedom is Choice, Constrained","Citizen explores just what freedom really is as it follows a young man, Thorby, as he matures from boy to man. Starting as a slave sold to a most unusual beggar, Baslim, we see the first aspect that many equate with the absolute opposite of freedom, though we see that in fact 'slaves' sometimes have more freedom of choice than 'free men'. The society he paints here is vivid and believable (though the economics of slavery in a star-travelling culture has always seemed a little dubious to me). Baslim is far more than he appears to be, and puts Thorby through a rigorous education, both academic and practical. How do you become a really good beggar? Here Heinlein falls in with Ayn Rand - whatever you do, do it to the best of your ability, from begging to juggling. Also there are several comments included here about the integrity of the self - lies to others and misleading yourself both come in for some dictums. These are items that may pass over young readers' heads, but perhaps planting seeds that all assumptions should be examined, nothing should be accepted on 'faith', that personal integrity is more important than 'success', that consequences of actions should be examined carefully before committing to that action. Later, Baslim calls in some favors and sends Thorby to live with the Free Traders, a group of space merchants that keep to themselves with their own unique culture. Here Thorby discovers another aspect of freedom: a person's ability to do as he wishes is severely constrained by the culture in which he lives. The Free Trader society (which owes much to Margaret Mead's seminal ideas, and highlighted by an anthropologist character named Margaret Mader - Heinlein was not usually so obvious with his names) of rigid matriarchal domination and separation into moieties provides security, peace of mind, and the ability through rigid rules of formalism to allow a small group of people to live together for extended periods without breaking any heads, but has as its downside great limitations on freedom of choice. This section of the book may be the best part, as the society is so different from today's American culture that it becomes fascinating in its own right, apart from its effects on Thorby. Thorby himself grows and changes significantly in this part of the book, from first love to determining just how he must balance the demands of duty and personal desires.  The last section deals with Thorby back on Earth, within a society not much different from our own, and shows a third aspect of freedom: the internal courageousness to make your own decisions and act upon them. Freedom is just as constrained by internal timidity and/or defining decisions as by external forces. As this last section offers little in terms of new or different views of society (though it is a good mirror of some of the flaws of a capitalistic/lawyer dominated one), it isn't as engrossing as the first two sections, but is highly important in terms of completing Heinlein's thematic investigation of all aspects of freedom.Characterization other than Thorby and Baslim is pretty thin, especially for the females that appear in supporting roles. This was fairly typical for his juveniles, as they were basically strong adventure novels with their primary focus on their central character. But the thematic line on slavery/freedom is much stronger here than most of his messages in other books, and as this particular position is also stated in some of those other works (most especially Farnham's Freehold), has to be seen as one of Heinlein's personal beliefs (unlike some other positions he proposes in his books that seem mainly designed to stir up debate).  This book is not Heinlein's absolute best, nor even the best of his so-called 'juveniles' (which are typically better reading than most 'adult' mainstream bestsellers), but still provides an engrossing, fun, and illuminating read. Recommended for all readers willing to look at life styles different from their own.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)",1

His parents said how much both books helped.  It is just so hard for children to understand death.  I think this book goes a long way in validating a child's feelings.  So often children don't know what to feel, they know grief, but there is so much more than that.  It truly helps when children know it's ok to be confused, hurt, and just upset.  I HIGHLY recommend this book",1
"274","Packs an emotional wallop","In some ways KM Soehnlein's THE WORLD OF NORMAL BOYS reminded me of the teenage novels of Paul Zindel.  There is that same depth of feeling along with characters that can break your heart and make you laugh at the same time.  Zindel wrote specifically for adolescents.  Soehnlein does not have those restrictions and has written a brutally honest book about homosexual experimentation among post-pubescent boys and its social implications.  Although the book is written for adults, it speaks on a deep personal level to the adolescent in all of us.THE WORLD OF NORMAL BOYS is the story of a family that falls apart when a tragic accident befalls the youngest child.  The story is seen through the eyes of the victim's 13-year-old brother as he tries to find something to hold on to while his mother drifts into alcoholism, his father goes nuts, his sister becomes a religious fanatic (and a kleptomaniac) and he finds himself smitten with two boys.  One is Todd, the athletic and arrogant brother of his girl-pal confidante who lives next door.  The other is Scott, a boy who deals drugs, cuts school and has an alcoholic father who beats him.  All the characters are vividly rendered.  If this were ever turned into a film, the actress who plays the mother would probably win an Oscar just for her final scene in the car.This is powerful and emotional writing.  I found it very moving.  It's tempting to want to recommend this book to a wide audience, but I am reticent because there are several scenes of furtive and unacknowledged sex between teenage boys that could upset some people.But I will never forget this book.

We feel a great deal of pressure to help our children achieve this important skill, but typically don't know how to go about it.Tracey presents a refreshingly straightforward, step-by-step approach to teaching reading skills.  The book is chock-full of word lists, fun activities, games, and creative ideas to engage a child's interest and get him reading.  There are helpful book recommendations for readers of all levels (including parents!) and pointers on spotting reading problems early, with practical suggestions for getting help.  The book is spiced with humorous anecdotes parents can truly appreciate.  Tracey's compassion and commonsense shine through and take the stress out of teaching kids to read.I highly recommend this book to parents of beginning readers.",1

However, after reading this novel, I am a stronger proponent of it than ever.  Enter Clay Carter - unknown defender in D.C. of the poorest of the poor.  Then a nice juicy settlement falls into his lap, one he can't refuse, partly because the parent's of his long-time girlfriend are pressuring him regarding his money.Give Carter a taste of money, then the greed sets in.  For the middle half of the book, we get to see unadulterated greed come to run his life!  Especially infuriating is how he lets that greed come before the well-being of his clients.  This is what will be his undoing.  One of his clients who was already ticked off at a settlement he made gets a terminal illness and decides to go after his lawyer.  This is the rags to riches to almost rags in the course of about eighteen months.Grisham actually makes you feel sympathetic with the main charater (Clay Carter) through his rise, and especially his fall.  That shows to the quality of his storytelling.  In fact, while Carter is in some ways a sympathetic character, he mostly is not!  Mass torts and greed is the theme of this story.  The fact that he came back to haunt him was only justice.  Too bad such justice doesn't often happen in the real world of mass torts",1

He not only wants Stephanie dead, but he also wants her end to be spectacular.Stephanie's response is to break up with her steady boyfriend, Joe Morelli, again, gorge on jelly donuts, and go into hiding at one of Ranger's lairs.  Of course, this doesn't work as well as it should because even Ranger's soap is too sexy for words.  And Stephanie, glutton for punishment that she is, she has to go out and make sure everyone knows that she is trying to keep a low profile.  So, you see, this is standard Stephanie Plum fare - lighthearted mayhem and a heroine who is half macho and half wuss, usually with bad timing.My issue with Evanovich's books isn't with any particular one, but with what happens if you read too many at one time.  Stephanie's biggest problem is herself - a decided lack of common sense.  Which is what you would expect from someone who works as a bounty hunter, but leaves her gun in the cookie jar.  In four hundred pages this is funny, but if you've been reading a lot in a row, the steady diet of vaudeville sight gags is dï¿½jï¿½ vu all over again.  After a break of a year or so this goes away and I found Ten Big Ones a pleasure to read.  It introduces a whole ne order of plot complication and one of the more remarkable bus drivers in literary history.  By all means, if you need a break from the weight of the world, take the time to read this. ",1

"325","4 Set CD of Meditations from the Book","This is a 4 CD set of meditations as a companion to The Inner Temple of WitchCraft book.  Using the background of the book, the CD's set up an easy way to work with the material in the book without having to open the book to reference it during the mediations. Mr. Penczak's voice is perfect as far as I am concerned, it does not grate on you nor does it lull you into sleep.  The light melodic fill is just that, filler for the spaces between words and does not distract from the words. I found the material covered to be good for meditation and it works well with the material in the book.  If you find the book to be what you are looking for, the CD's are a good addition. I enjoyed the entire presentation, and Mr. Penczak gives us some very well based and solid material. boudic",1
"583","A good resource, but opportunities are missed","This volume contains a lot of valuable information, and is the only work of its kind I am aware of, ie an exhaustive survey of worldwide charismatic Christianity. That alone earns it four stars.However, I was disappointed that the editors chose to write from a pro-charismatic bias that may alienate non-charismatics. Indeed, some of the shorter entries seem more like blurbs for the ministers and movements they represent rather than academic, encyclopaedic introductions. The problem is not with what information is included so much as what information is *not* included - for example, absent from the entry on Oral Roberts is any mention of the dubious fundraising techniques and outrageous publicity stunts for which he is most (in)famous. Ian Bilby's entry details his leadership of Elim New Zealand, but includes no mention of the sexual scandal that led to his removal as Elim's NZ leader. All but the most staggering embarrassments in Pentecostalism's history seem glossed over, as if not offending anyone was a major principle in deciding what to include.I would expect a scholarly work to reflect both the glory and the shame of this important subject. This is an annoyance in an otherwise very good work.",1

"458","Outstanding glimpse into the lives of undocumented Mexicans","Written all the way back in the mid-1980s, long before all the heated rhetoric about illegal immigration going on in the US today, this book has turned out to be amazingly prescient. I feel like I would have had a much better understanding of this subject (not to mention appreciation of the people involved) had I discovered it a long time ago, but I suppose late is better than never.Ted Conover did what I don't imagine very many other Americans would have the courage to do: Cross illegally from Mexico into the US with Mexicans doing the same thing. In doing so, he gives readers incredible insight into what compels some Mexicans to make that journey (i.e what life is like where they come from), what the journey is like, and what awaits them on this side of the border. I found myself exceedingly grateful for having been born American and simply in awe of the Mexicans who live such vastly disparate lives from their privileged neighbors to the north.Conover simply relates his experiences to readers without the kind of  ideological commentary or other editorializing that can get in the way of the facts surrounding the contentious issues involved. Coyotes is a well-written, touching, informative, and inspiring book that should be required reading for all Americans before they open their mouths about illegal immigration",1

"942","Brilliant and Untouchable","While some may think that good work should be ""readable and enjoyable,""  great work is meant to elevate us. Stun us, amaze us, fill us with wonder.  Otherwise, See Spot Run would be a masterpiece.  William Faulkner is a writer the likes of which we may never see again.  He is not only brilliant of word but of concept.  He creates a picture not only by text, but by context and form.  In many ways, his works sculpt.  How else would we see things from the vistas of the characters, especially those who can't speak but by setting and demonstration?One reviewer cursed his conveyance of emotion by ""using big words.""  Writing is the art of language interplay, the use of beautiful and succinct language.  Faulkner uses language that most of us have never heard of but when we take the time to look up that language, the effect is stunning and makes the experience all the more worth it. ",1
"521","Well illustrated and explained.","If you are just starting out on photography, I highly recommend this book. It begins immediately on the first chapter on picture making! For this reason alone, I would give it 5 stars. Here in the first chapter, the authors wasted no time to tell you what makes good pictures: the photographer, not the equipment. They then proceed to explain why the majority of our pictures (at least, the rest of us non-professionals) turn out unflattering despite our best efforts and high-tech cameras. If you read nothing else but the first chapter alone, I would bet that your photography will already begin to improve. Or if not, the first chapter will at least inspire you to try the suggestions and see the result yourself. In fact, even if all you have is a humble point and shoot film camera, the things they teach in the first chapter are still totally valid, as the principles of good photography remains the same whether you use film or digital.The next chapters give details about camera operations, how to creatively use camera controls, and another great topic, how to tackle different photographic subjects. Just what I needed! I like the chapter on how to process you own film in black and white. Although I'll probably not dive into it, this chapter gives you good grounding on the grassroots of photography.Other good stuff inside:1. Projects at the end of most every chapter. I dare you to do all the project at chapter one and tell me if it will not improve your understanding of what makes a good picture!2. Information on digital aspect of photography. Although I shoot film slr, I know that one day, I'll want a digital slr so the info on it is nice.3. All the illustative pictures are ones that can be done by amateurs! In keeping with the beginner's purpose, this is intentional on the part of the authors. If you are looking for award winning photos or famous photographers, you wont find it here. But the pictures in the book are beautiful in their own right and they drive home the points taught. 4. Modest studio lighting you can create yourself! The principles on the very important aspect of light taught here are very revealing to me. The diagram of how to photograph a subject using only your own flash and any old white card to reflect some light is already a good starting point.However, I am tempted to give this book 4 stars since I felt that despite it's generous information, attractive layout, highly readable text, and wide pages, the authors skimmed the topic on tricky exposure problems. The use of grey cards, spotmeters, and handheld lightmeters to solve these tough light problems were only briefly explained. On the other hand, they provided easily applied solutions to our most common exposure problems. So I give them the benefit of the doubt that such issues correctly belong to advanced photography topics which might only discourage the wobbly beginner if mentioned here. Now that you are aware of it, you will probably do more research on it. Meanwhile, a lot of my pictures are already much improved by the application of the principles in the book alone.I therefore, highly recommend this book to fellow beginners in photography",1

I liked that 'The Regulators' adds a little more information about the mysterious Tak.  Here we see a more terribly playful, oddly fastidious, and possibly younger Tak who loves spaghetti, chocolate milk, westerns, and Cassie Stiles.  And while most of the characters of 'The Regulators' are flatter than those of 'Desperation,' 'The Regulators' gives us a glimpse of what some inhabitants of Desperation might have been like before Tak possessed them, particularly Audrey and Collie who were never shown ""pre-Tak"" in 'Desperation.",1

"835","Jules Gets Four Stars","Suzanne Brockmann is an unbelievable writer and her stories always draw me in.  The ""mystery"" portion of the story and the romance between Jane and Cosmo left a little to be desired.  I really didn't understand why Jane had to have her alternative personality as Mercedes and Cosmo was a little to soft for keeping up the hardened SEAL persona.  These particular characters seemed a bit empty compared to Jules and Robin, who clearly stole the show in this book. As a matter of fact, of the different plots and stories going on in this book, Jules' was the best.  It was not only very well-written and sweet, but even as a hetrosexual female, I could identify with Jules and how he felt at times because what was happening to him, happens to all of us, whether you are in a gay or straight relationship.  I am really hoping that Jules either gets his own book, or has more appearances in future novels where he does find true happiness. I do share Ms. Brockmann's opinion when it comes to differences in appearance, nationality, sexual orientation, etc. and I really like how she includes this in her books.  As far as I'm concerned love is love, no matter what and it's portrayed beautifully here.Please Ms. Brockmann, don't allow the naysayers to steer you away from this storyline, it's a very good one",1

The reason: this book shows the letters and has beautiful illustrations of many items in one picture that begin with each letter. Some things are easy to find in the picture and others are more challenging. It is a beautiful book that provides ""I spy"" and ""Where's Waldo"" type challenges. I highly recommend this book for the 1-5 crowd",1
"929","Fabulous history","I studied the medieval Islamic world a little in college, and fell in love. It's a fascinating age in which Central Asian Buddhists, North African nomads, Ethiopian slaves, Greek cave-dwellers, Persian aristocrats, Arab bureaucrats and a host of different cultures came together, mixed, wrote wonderful literature, and lived the kind of drama that makes history fun. But it's hard to find anything written about the time that isn't arcane professor babble or Islam 101. (You know, ""There are five pillars of Islam..."" Snore.)Here Hugh Kennedy has written the book I always wanted. He wisely concentrates on medieval Islam's golden age, the early Abbasid dynasty, when Baghdad ruled a large portion of the world-and, even more astutely, on the dramatic stories and personalities of the court. Let's face it, you read about the Abbasids because you want to know how the slave girl Khayzuran not only managed to marry the caliph but to quell a military revolt, why her son Harun al-Rashid was immortalized in The Arabian Nights, and why the all-powerful Barmakid family suddenly fell from grace to prison and execution. Kennedy brings the caliphs and their families to life. He's up front about the fact that the book is about aristocrats, but the common people of Baghdad, the ""pickpockets and sellers of cheap sweets"" who fought back when their city was besieged, and the middle class who developed Islamic tradition dance around the edge of the narrative.Kennedy doesn't believe everything he reads, and doesn't think you will either. He repeats stories-like the ""harem intrigue"" tales, in which devious women are blamed for various deaths-that are almost certainly not true, but tell us something about the people who believed them, and are still enormously entertaining. He also is frank about the same-sex relationships, male and female, that were a part of the era's culture, without the awkwardness of many modern historians. And he's smart enough to explain the geography-why southern Iraq could support such a fabulously wealthy monarchy, and why the Afghanistan/NE Iran region was so critical to the faraway Middle East-in a way an American can understand. Very rare for books on Islamic history, the book boasts an excellent map, naming both cities and regions-invaluable for a hapless Westerner who doesn't know where the major cities of Iran are today, never mind where long-gone kingdoms like Yamama and Ushrusana used to be. There's also a surprisingly good index (another rarity).The book isn't flawless. Kennedy twice awkwardly interrupts his straightforward account of political events with fascinating chapters on aspects of court culture-palaces, poetry, science, and (my favorite) women's lives. Unfortunately, this structure means the reader learns about the palace Mutawakkil built before she knows enough about him to care, and doesn't hear anything about Ma'mun patronage of scientific research until long after he's dead in the main narrative. The last chapter goes into far too much detail about the depressing downfall of the dynasty, short-changing a more interesting discussion about its legacy. But all in all Kennedy does a great job, and I for one plan down to hunt down his earlier books.If you know nothing about Islamic history and want an accessible introduction to an fascinating period, or like me know a little and want to learn more, I highly recommend this book",1

"505","A work that is compassionately direct yet psychologically and spiritually humane.","For most of us, the area of thanatology is something quite new, despite the fact that death is such an intimate ""companion"" that can come at any moment of our lives, whether by degrees or instantaneously, irrelevant of our ethnic, social and economic backgrounds. It is a plain truth that can not be avoided, and no technological advancements can make it go away. I would personally like to consider death as the ultimate best friend who would never desert you, despite what your feelings may be. And as a child has the innocent ablity to humanize a doll or a toy soldier, the adult must equally do so with death, not shy away from it and be totally uncommunicative to what it means: the total cessation of physical life, for if one denys its existence and its inevitability, the person could not only suffer from added unnecessary physical heartache, but he or she could also augment the physical stress with mental, spiritual and religious grief as well. Submission to and acceptance of the truth, no matter how difficult it would be to hear, could be the highest catharsis that medicine could not come close to healing. In Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's classic study of the dying process, she interviews patients of various age brackets who teach the living what dying means to them. But even though the experience is individualistic to that specific person, the process of dying has a universality to it which connects us all. Hence, how do you take the sting from the wound? In On Death and Dying, you remove the sting by communication and by simply being there to let the patient say what he or she has to say, to let them vent, and at their own pace, go through the classic defined stages of the dying process: denial and isolation, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. The patients become our teachers. We learn of their fears, their possible financial burdens, in one woman's case, the fear of the worms, et cetera. But we also learn about what the families go through, their own anger and disbelief and guilt. It is about pacing and the opening up of repressed fear for all the people involved. Sometimes there is cohesion in the shock and anger, other times not. The United States is one of the most death-denying countries out there, a fact most evident with plastic surgery on the rise and chiseled bodies to reverse the aging process, for going foward means only one thing: death. Ross's overall message is that death does not have to be and is not the horror that we all think it is, the grim reaper with the skeletal hand and the sharpened scythe. Death has issues for everybody, doctors, faith-filled people, even Ross heself. It is a step that we are all going to take sooner or later. But it is comforting to know that we are all in it together.   ",1
"116","Heartfelt Tale of Women in Rural China","This is a simple, yet heartfelt and elegant tale of the lives and struggles of women in rural China of the 1920s and 1930s. The story centers on Pei, who as a young girl, is sold by her parents to work in a silk factory.  The story evolves as Pei befriends other women in the silk factory, participates in a strike for fair working conditions, reconnects with her family, loses loved ones, and escapes from advancing Japanese soldiers. The plot is succinct and the characters are interesting, varied, and believable, if perhaps lacking somewhat in psychological depth.  Socio-cultural aspects of life in 1920s-30s China are elegantly woven into the plot.  Themes of friendship, love, and courage are convincingly presented.  Overall, the book is a captivating read, and strongly recommended. ",1
"672","Western Liberalism on Trial","In Faith in Nation, Anthony Marx delivers a spirited rebuttal of the ""literary trope"" (p 15) about a liberal, inclusive Western nationalism. Instead, he argues that even the ""truest"" brand of Western nationalism-that of England and France-came to being only after brutal fratricide of massive scale. His entire theory is based on a central position that nationalism developed much earlier than is popularly believed today. This leads one to question why does he insist on such a position? Has he made the case for it? What happens to his theory if the position turns out to be wrong? I will argue that the definition of the state, or the lack thereof, is key to answering all of the above questions. Only by implicitly loosening the definition of the state, can Marx trace the genesis of Western nationalism back to as early as the 16th century, thus cementing the linkage between Western nationalism and religious violence. However, the liberal adaptation of the concept of the state puts Marx's entire theory on shaky ground.  According to Marx, the state is the raison d'tat of nationalism: for nationalism to become a historical force, it ""must ... refer to a state as an existing structure or potential object of engagement"" (p 8). Although he declares early and clearly what nationalism is (p 4), he never spells out his definition of a state. In fact, what we would think of as a modern state today can hardly be found in 16th century Europe. Only when the definition of a state is sufficiently loosened, can Marx backdate nationalism to the 16th century, when most of the political authorities at the time existed in the form of royal courts. Only after he pushes back the genesis of nationalism, can Marx connect the religious violence of the 16th century to nationalism. Only when the religious violence is viewed as part of the history of nation building, does it acquire significance in the nature of Western nationalism. Otherwise, the St. Barthelme Day massacre or the burnings at Smithfield is just another ""normal"" religious upheavals in history, thus any association the massacre or the burnings may have with nation building would be purely coincidental-as Liah Greenfeld implied when Marx quoted her in saying, ""Frenchness was disassociating itself from Catholicism."" To Anthony Marx, however, French nationalism and its French Catholic identity are not external to each other. They are just different stages in the same dialectic process. Therefore, real ""Frenchness"" is actually the public oblivion in France of the strange relationship between the church and the state1. Yet all the grand reasoning depends on Marx's definition of the state. After all, can we call the royal courts of the 16th century ""states""? Not only has Marx not given his readers a clear answer, some of his own writings seem to contradict each other. For example, Marx mentions that the Treaty of Westphalia marks the beginning of the modern states (p 35). But the French War of Religions and the reign of Mary Tudor-the very conflicts that are supposedly at the core of nation-state building-occurred almost a century earlier. Even if we use the later date, 1648, as the beginning of the state system, one still has to be cautious to label all subsequent political authorities ""states"". Regardless whether Louis XIV actually said ""I am the state"", the fact that monarchical authority is directly associated with an individual ruler makes it transient in nature (relative to institutionalized modern government), therefore it can hardly be designated the ""object of engagement"" for nationalist ideology. Since Marx's concept of the state is on shaky ground, his entire theory appears highly questionable. I would argue, however, there are two options that can salvage his arguments. One is to weaken the link between nationalism and the state. In other words, nationalism may develop independent of the state. This observation may have a wider application outside of the context of Western history than inside of it. The other option is to introduce a third element, such as political culture, that can bridge the violent past and state and nation building in later times. For example, one accepts that the massive fratricide did happen earlier than the emergence of the nation-state. Nevertheless, the bloodshed molded a new political culture, which manifested itself as a more inclusive nationalism when the nation-state took shape later. If such an interpretation proves to be a more sensible reading of history than that of Marx, then Marx's criticism of Western nationalism can be easily appropriated to deconstruct the Western political culture-the liberal democracy-itself: that it has a ugly past but short memory. However, is the world ready for such a ""total recall""?",1

"697","Historically Based Information With An Emphasis On The Weird And Wacky","""Underground Education"" does not so much offer a radical intellectual perspective, as is perhaps implied by the title. But rather is a collection of funny stories and oddball facts about various people and events from the past. Some of the historical figures are famous, such as George Washington and Cleopatra. While others, like the several female serial killers discussed, are more obscure. The book is divided into 10 chapters, including the arts, religion, science and sex. Actually, this book reminds me somewhat of the ""People's Almanac"" series written by David Wallechinsky. But here the emphasis is definitely on the strange and often perverse. It's a fun read for those interested in this sort of knowledge. But some entries are overlong and most readers will probably want to read the sections of greatest interest rather than cover to cover. Still it is a worthwhile purchase.",1

Of course, it also describes (and shows, in beautiful photographs), their projects, but it's a great way to see into the personal side of the amateur engineers, bored brainiacs, and fringe-worthy souls who are the heart of the newest form of the DIY geek culture: creating incredible, real-world projects, from the mega (a home built submarine for 3) to the micro, (a diy bat detector), to the whimsical (a Lego blocks project that will solve the Rubik's Cube).If you're a vociferous reader of Slashdot, you may have seen some of these projects before, but the book really gets into the motivation behind them. Production values, writing, and design are superb, and of course, URLs are provided so you can find out more on the makers' sites.Bottom line, this fascinating survery of Make culture (and cool projects) is a must for every geek's coffee table, and it's also a great way to introduce your mom into what it is you actually do with your spare time..",1
"937","Anna Anderson WAS Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia","Anna Anderson/ Anastasia I have researched this great mystery for some time now and I have concluded that the woman, Anna Anderson, could not have been an imposter. Not only did she never give any signs of playing a part, but she was in posession of all sorts of little facts and information that no one on the outside could have known. She knew of Gleb Botkin's paintings before he even came to see her, she knew exactly what she and her sister Tatiana had been doing while WWI was being declared for Russia (this was confirmed by Dr. Rudnev who was visiting Russia and saw Anastasia and Tatiana at that time), she had intimate knowledge of every single royal house in Europe, and could recognize her royal cousins- sight unseen- by their voices alone. One must wonder how a demented Polish farming girl could do that. Aside from just her character, there the many scars and lacerations on her body, as well as the bunions on her feet identical to Anastasia and the cautorized mole on the shoulder which was verified to have been on the young Anastasia as well by a standart officer who did not even support Anna Anderson's claim. For over six decades, Royal cousins and friends to Anastasia would try and trip this woman up with tricks. They would misstate things just to see if she would catch them and she always would. It is virtually impossible for someone to go 65 years without ever being caught in a mistake. Anna had people such as Alexei Volkov and Alexadra Tegleva in tears after having met her because they were so touched. No one has ever yet attempted to explain why Ambassador Zahle and Grand Duke Andrew's papers are still kept secret, why Doris Wingender touched up her photographs in court, or why Pierre Gilliard had his scandalous midnight 'burning' of evidence. To this day, anthropologists who compare Anna Anderson's face, ears, and handwriting specimens to the young girl she claimed to be declare with certainty that the ""two"" women are the same.    The Franziska Schanzkowska story is clearly a lie from beginning to end. Anna Anderson was several inches shorter than Franziska Schanzkowska, wore a size shoe three inches smaller, was not mentally insane like Franziska, she spoke a bad German while FS spoke German as her first language, and could understand Russian. The Schanzkowska siblings did not understand a word of Russian when spoken to them. AA clearly understood Russian. Anderson also gave birth to a child. There is no record of Franziska ever having a child. Recent documents also show that Schanzkowska was never injured in the grenade explosion which supposedly infliced the wounds on Anna Anderson's body. The DNA tests have won the hour, but I hope the future will see the release of Ambassador Zahle and GD Andrew's papers to cast even more doubt on this. Richard Schweitzer's switch theory is very probable given the doubts about the identification with Schanzkowska as well as the security measures which were not that good at Martha Jefferson Hospital during the complicated court battle between Marina Botkin Schweitzer and the Russian Nobiltiy Association. According to Massie's book, one researcher was even allowed access to the intestinal tissue during this time. Is it reasonable that the Royal families would ignore the fact that Anna Anderson was about to recieve recognition as the Tsar's daughter after they had been fighting to disprove her all her life?    In any case, the body of Anastasia is still missing, although in Russia there lies a body under the coffin which reads 'Anastasia' measuring 5'7, despite the fact that Anastasia was the shortest of her sisters. If this isn't reason enough to be suspicious that there is some sort of agenda, I don't know what is. I'm afraid however that the body lies in the ashes spread over Castle Seeon under the stone which reads, ""Anastasia Manahan 1901-1984"".    To end this, I will quote Empress Alexandra's best friend (aside from Anna Vyrobouva) Lili Dehn, who met Anna Anderson in 1957(?) and declared, ""Don't bother to tell me she has read these things in books. I have recognized her physically and intuitively, through signs which do not decieve. What can I say after having known her? I could not have been mistaken.""This is to explain my conviction that Anna Anderson was Anastasia. I think there is something about the DNA we do not know. The File on the Tsar- 2002 edition... p. 362 'Nearly fifty years ago, Anna Anderson told a story about a sketch she and her sister had put on to amuse their parents during their confinement in Tobolsk. She played a male part, she 'recalled', and and had to borrow a man's dressing-gown. At a pivotal moment in the play, a freak draught made the dressing gown billow up around their thighs, revealing that she was wearing the tsar's long-johns- against the bitter cold of the Siberian winter. The family, said Anna Anderson, had hooted with laughter. The only witnesses from the imperial household who would have been present at that scene, and who are known to have survived, were the two family tutors-both foreigners. One was the English tutor, Sydney Gibbes, and his memoirs were published for the first time in 1975. They include this account of an incident during amatuer theatricals in Tobolsk. ""The cast,"" Gibbes wrote, ""had its happiest night with an Edwardian farce by Henry Grattan, called 'Packing Up', ... Anastasia took the male part... at the end of the farce the 'Husband' had to turn his back, open his Dressing-gown as if to take it off- Anastasia used an old one of mine... but a draught got under the gown and whisked its tail up to the middle of her back, showing her sturdy legs and bottom encased Emperor Jaguer's underwear...' So far as exhaustive research can establish, only Anna Anderson had ever before told this vivid ancedote, in private and three decades before the Gibbes memoirs appeared. If Anderson was a phoney, as the seemingly damning DNA evidence now tells us, how did she know the story? That was one of the myriad puzzles that believers in Anna Anderson had to confront when the scientists delivered their verdict. Ian Lilburn, a research historian and the only observer to attend every session of the ""Anastasia"" appeal process in the German courts, had a calmer response than some. ""I think,"" he said, knowing he sounded like a Luddite and Romanov flat-earther, "" there is something we don't know about the DNA."" Maybe after reading you can understand why some of us don't believe the DNA was Anna Anderson's, and why we don't believe she was the tall, size '36 shoe wearing Franziska Schanzkowska who could not have had such exclusive info if she were an imposter.",1

"335","Rational Analysis","I read the second edition of this book since it is enlarged with the study of the housing market. The phenomenon of bubbles and negative bubbles or collapses is described extremely well by means of statistical data of markets for over a century and a half. The raw data is adjusted to inflation to give a realistic perspective of the trends and patterns. Bubbles seem to be occurring at regular intervals typically based on the ""new era"" story and everyone believes at least during the heady days that good times are here to stay. But as shown by proven evidence of the past, no bubble has sustained itself permanently and good reason prevails sooner or later. When this happens, the bloated bubble collapses and the hangover is terrible. The story so far is quite simple. But what makes this book so interesting is the depth of research and the manner in which the phenomenon is studied and explained.The combination of mass psychology and market prices is at the core of this book. For bubbles to happen, information flow is the key. Media plays a significant role in disseminating information and bubbles seem to have originated in recorded history after the advent of the print media. In recent times electronic media particularly the television and the internet play a significant role in speeding up bubble formation and also the reversals. Media needs a storyline and this story needs to be continued to retain customers on a daily basis. Stock market is the ideal place that offers an opportunity to try one's luck if a casino is far away. Backed by on-line dedicated news channels and internet trading, well, it is not surprising that we have day traders in herds. In such situations fundamentals like industry analysis and P/E ratios take a backseat as explained by the author. Historical averages are breached and a euphoria of ""once in a life time opportunity"" prevails. What happens to the Efficient Markets Theory in such situations?. Since this theory says that markets are perfectly priced based on all publicly available information there cannot be a situation of either under pricing or over pricing. This book perfectly challenges the efficiency and accuracy of this theory.It is unfortunate that substantial amounts of investments meant to be otherwise risk free sources of income, pension funds for example, are getting diverted into risky markets.  Here the author has come out with a list of some sound proposals to protect hard earned life long savings of innocent citizens who are exposed to the irrationality of markets.The bubble in the housing market is also discussed well. Housing seems to be isolated bubbles occurring in specific regions and not a global phenomenon. But nevertheless the damage can be the same. The party of low interest rate regime seems to be over and a spike in mortgage rates is sure to be the needle that will prick right through this big speculative bubble. What goes up has to come down ! But once you start reading this book, it is difficult to put it down. Intellectually stimulating and bound to be economically rewarding. ",1

"661","A Thoughtful and Important Book","This is an excellent book examining how and why some people come to believe that they have suffered appalling abuse that most probably never happened. It DOES NOT deny the reality of or harm caused by sexual abuse (the author explicitly states this on many occasions) and the reviewer who suggested that this is ""a terrific book if you are child molester"" probably (I guess) didn't bother reading it and made up the especially foul accusation to prevent others from examining the issues surrounding repressed memory and the cult of therapy.The author shows how even trained professionals can disregard overwhelming evidence against a particular hypothesis (repressed memory/MPD/satanic cults) and rely on their intuition to (unintentionally) wreak havoc with their clients lives. In the upside-down world of some therapists, lack of hard evidence is trumped by strength of feeling for even the most outrageous accusation. Pendergrast demonstrates how uncertain and malleable human memory can be.The book is written in an easy style and despite what another particularly stupid review suggests, concentrates specifically on the scientific evidence for his claims",1

"405","almost, but not quite...","A looming 21-year High School reunion has led me to ponder the past, especially the town I grew up in. I have been reading The Geography of Nowhere by James Howard Kuntsler, a book which explores the rise of suburbia and automobile culture in America. Kuntsler explores the effects of modernist design philosophy (Le Corbusier, Gropius, Bauhaus etc. ) . Although Kunstler's book is by no means a complete history, his insights are provocative. His basic thesis is that the rise of the automobile has led to the development of a banal and meaningless ""geography of nowhere"". In other words, since the 1920s, Americans have pursued a single-minded vision when it comes to urban development: namely treating our built surroundings as disposable commodities to be bought and sold, with little regard to aesthetics.  Growing up in a suburb, I experienced this sort of fake-non-reality-bubble of what a city should be, or what it should do for its residents. There was always nothing to do, nowhere to go. Fortunately, in those days, creative people created their own ""scene"", no matter how lame it was. Such a naive scene based on our libertine tastes and overbearing ignorance. Of course, conformity was the rule.  And we all nearly s--t ourselves when we got behind the wheel of our first car. It was almost like and 5-year-old's first trip to Disneyland. It was like that first sexual experience. It was an epiphany, of sorts.  Little did we realize that our addiction to auto travel would bring such a high cost to our lonely empty souls. Who ever thought that being so cheap would cost us so much?",1

"608","Love poems from the Heian era.","Jane Hirshfield and Mariko Aratani have done a marvelous job with the translation of these lovely tanka-- manages to capture both their fragility and robust complexity. I had a friend who was a Japanese scholar, who explained to me once the complexity of translating waka. I have nothing but admiration for those who can do it well. Hirshfield actually has an essay at the back of this book called ""On Japanese Poetry and the Process of Translation"". I recommend it highly, even if you do not normally read this kind of essay.I am a little bit afraid that the focus on the love poems and the emphasis on Ono no Komachi and Izumi Shikibu as female writers may give the wrong idea about the strength and importance of the poetry. Shikibu is widely considered the greatest poet of her period and Ono no Komachi was one of the Rokkasen-- the six best waka poets of the early Heian period. The reason that I am not giving this volume five stars is because of this packaging and not because of the poetry itself.These poems are a joy to read aside from any issues of scholarship. They are strong and sad and very affecting. There is actually no stronger recommendation to read this than the poems themselves, so I will close this review with one of the poems by Shikibu:What is the useof cherishing life in spring?Its flowersonly shackle usto this world",1

The main reason to me is that Ryle clarifies the concept of being human, while he uses language in a natural way.

He is far  from reductionistic; mark the subtle irony: 'Man need not be degraded to a  machine by being denied to be a ghost in a machine. He might, after all, be  a sort of animal, namely, a higher mammal. There has yet to be ventured the  hazardous leap to the hypothesis that perhaps he is a man.",1

"699","Incisive and novel critique - absolutely recommended","Colonial Fantasies is a powerfully argued and engaging dissection of colonial psychology, critiques of Orientalism that isolate gender and culture, and the Western feminist adoption of the rescue paradigm.  One of Yegenoglu's incisive arguments is that desire is the nexus in the process of colonial discourse that constitutes the Western subject as well as the possible resistance or interruption of this process.  As desire frames the relation between the subject and its other, Yegenoglu argues that the veil interrupts the relation.  As a barrier from which the other can see but avoid being seen, the veil is the site at which the colonialist desire is made manifest, but simultaneously displaced (62).  Her argumentation is lucid and compelling: for the colonial gaze, the veil is both the tantalizing object of desire (in the fantasy of unveiling) as well as the bte-noire, because it precludes the climax of the voyeuristic project.  The veil therefore frustrates the identity-forming process of the subject-object positioning in colonialist discourse; the subject cannot quite see the object, and its subjectivity thus remains in question.  Interestingly, this overtly phallocentric logic of identity forming through scopic penetration has been inherited by Western feminism.  As the veil has come to signify the backwardness of Islam and its inherent oppression of women, the visibility of the veil itself comes to embody difference.  In this dynamic, the identity of the liberated Western woman is constructed vis--vis the oppressed Muslim woman (102).  Since the status of Western women is contingent on the continued representation of Muslim women as oppressed, Yegenoglu reveals that the Western feminist establishment has a vested interest in the exceedingly patriarchal ideology of colonialism.  Yegenoglu then exposes the fallacy of assuming the unveiled woman to be normative; such universal constructions serve particular political ends in outmoded Enlightenment ideology.  She argues that unveiling and veiling are both cultural practices particular to certain cultures and historical moments (115).  This facilitates the deconstruction of the binary by unfixing the poles.  In sum, Yegenoglu's critical analysis of the colonial fantasy has produced a thorough tome sure to provoke further discussion among post-colonial theorists",1
"663","Heroic and On Target. ","Phyllis Chesler is a most unusual feminist. She really doesn't fit in with the equity feminist crowd and is a complete dissenter from the female superiority, gender feminist crowd. The one thing that makes her consistently worth reading is her passion for telling the truth. This seems to be her most pervasive (and endearing) feature as an intellectual, and the trait was ubiquitously on display throughout her recent ""Death of Feminism"" release. Here she tackles a verboten subject which is whether or not women are the unbridled source of goodness that many feminists assume them to be. Numerous examples of misapplied and unprovoked indirect aggression are identified and elucidated in the text. On the whole, it makes for compelling reading. We find that women are regular human beings just like everyone else. They have many of the same, yet subtlety different, characteristics as do men. In these pages, Chesler illustrates the magnitude of inter-woman hostility as their strong social skills can often be applied in a negative manner. Many mother-daughter conflicts are projected into adult situations. Why feminists wouldn't have wanted this published seems rather silly to me. We should regard women as they are and not as objects of fantasy. Chesler never implies any inter-sex superiority or inferiority, she is content to describe what is, and it's great stuff indeed.",1
"796","A modern day search for the truth - with disheartening results","I have spent a lot of time and money researching into Mormon history. The big problem is that, as Henry Ford once said ""History is bunk"". With Joseph Smith and the history of the Mormon church, there are hundreds of accounts that argue that he was an inspired prophet and just as many, an ingenious charlatan. There are even accounts that avoid making a judgement either way and leave it up to the reader to decide. Hence, using history as a basis for discovering the truth about the history of Joseph Smith can be a very frustrating (and sometimes expensive) exercise. The Church itself avoids encouraging the study of historical events to gain testimony, but instead promotes the individual member to gain a spiritual testimony. It is easy to see from my statement above, why.This book takes a completely different approach in investigating the truthfulness of what Joseph Smith produced. Forget about what might have happened in the early 1800's and instead, focus on the actual record contained in the Book of Mormon itself. Let current day investigation be the basis for the search of truth instead of historical personal accounts. This removes any bias of the source material and hence allows for an objective study.Thomas Stuart Ferguson starts out as the Book of Mormon's most enthusiastic proponent. He sacrifices a large portion of his life both petitioning the First Presidency for financial support, and performing extensive archaeological expeditions to find evidence of the civilisations documented in the Book of Mormon (BofM). While he expects an abundance of material to be discovered, he finds none. Nothing. No evidence of the language or writings contained within the BofM, the animals and crops mentioned, artefacts, city names, weapons, metals, glass etc. Nothing for the period documented within the BofM (2500 BC - 400 AD). There are few discoveries outside this timeline, but none within. All he wanted (and expected) to find were actual artefacts or at least murals/pictorials showing the above documented items. The turning point came when fragments of the Joseph Smith papyri were rediscovered in the late 1960's and found to contain nothing in common with The Book of Abraham. This is a completely separate quest in itself (see ""By His Own Hand Upon Papyrus"").While Ferguson may have lost his faith, he never left the LDS church and continued to attend and support it - he even sent a son on a mission. He believed the Mormon church was ""the best fraternity on earth"". In public, he was a ""normal"" member, in private circles he believed Joseph Smith was a fraud and as a result, spent the remainder of his life researching why.This book is both a document detailing Ferguson's quest for the truth, and his way of dealing with it from the result.",1

"554","Dorm Room Diet - Solid Lifestyle Approach for All Really","Oz talks sense. From the first chaper, I was hooked. She suggested making a minor change for the first week. I cut back on one soft drink per day - from 3 down to 2. That was quite painless. I also took her starter tips - drink water before meals and don't eat closer than 2 hours before bedtime. Again, those were minor and didn't crimp my style.This is not really a diet book though it deals with diet (as in what you eat). It's really about living well and making mostly good choices but not going overboard (and ultimately failing). Oz is a vegetarian, but she said that red meat was fine in moderation. Go for only twice per week on that she suggested. I love beef, but I also like chicken and fish and can tweak that part of my meal plan. Chips are junk food, but a bowl isn't a huge deal. Just don't grab the bag and keep munching. If you have an urge for chocolate, melt some semi-sweet chocolate and dip fruits like strawberries in the chocolate. It really does satisfy that chocolate craving with smaller amounts of chocolate.That's typical of her advice and things that I can handle and maintain.She also talks about exercise and about supplements (meant to supplement and not take the place of good food). She's reasonable with her ideas here as well. I added some extra work out time (even jogging 5 minutes while watching TV adds up if you do it pretty often) and bought a basic vitamin plus B, C and E (all heartily approved by my doc). Oz lost 10 pounds her first semester. This is not a crash course. She's down 30 lbs now (over 2 years I think) - just slowly and surely. And, she's maintained rather than yo-yo'ing.I think most people (college or not) would benefit from reading this book and trying out Oz's common sense plan. Older readers might need a little less food overall and might not opt to go out and have a snowball fight to burn calories, but the basics are here for a good lifestyle plan that isn't painful and does work.This would be a great book for anyone (females more so) headed off to college or in college. Oz has dealt with being overweight. She did a lot of research and put a workable plan into action. I think most readers will love her style and also will be able to use her ideas and stay slimmer and healthier.   ",1

"481","An immense poetic achievement","Add this reviewer to the list of people who hold Paradise Lost up to the lofty title of The Greatest Epic Poem in the English Language; it is not only this, but one of the best in any language. Writing unabashedly in the tradition of unrhymed Homeric epic verse, Mitlon was working well within what was earlier purveyed by Homer, Virgil, and Dante -- but he brings his own distinctive touch and flair to the work. The opening lines of the long poem are clearly inspired by Homer, as are other elements, but Milton has a very unique poetic style; long sentences, often with the principle verb at the end, being one of its mainstays. This language is very grandiose and quite complex; it takes a while to get used to it -- you will have to pay very close attention during the first book -- but, as with most classical literature, once the reader gets the hang of it, it goes quite smoothly. The Divine Comedy of Dante has a more towring reputation than does Milton's Paradise Lost -- for one thing, it is older -- but I among those who find Milton to be superior. The Divine Comedy is, certainly, an undisputed masterpiece, but, where it was, more or less, a satire and a thinly-veiled attack on many of Dante's political enemies, Milton's work deals with much more complex and profound subject matter:  why mankind fell, how the gods themselves operate and think, the nature and attractiveness of evil and sin, the importance of love in human relationships, the moral problems of God's justice. It is true that Dante's work is more original; Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained, at least in seed, come straight from The Bible. But Milton only uses these stories as a springboard for the exploration of the latent moral and ethical problems lurking beneath. Milton explores these problems with a refreshingly fresh perspective -- strictly within the Christian tradition, to be sure, but far from fundamentalist, and even quite radical for its day. Although some cite the work as Christian apologist, there are certainly many elements within the poem that many of the more hard-line Christians would be taken aback by; it was, of course, even more controversial in its day. One thing about the work that often gets pointed out is that Satan is a far more interesting and appealing character than God. This, in my view, does not have Milton unwittingly on the Devil's side, as some critics have suggested. Rather, he is pointing out how appealing sin is always is:  of course it's interesting, of course it's appealing -- otherwise, we wouldn't keep falling for it again and again and again. If we saw its razor-sharp fangs and [dripping] mouth, we would have stopped getting ensnared in its trap long ago. However, as a non-Christian myself, I cannot but disagree with some points of Milton's theodicy; the last two books, in particular, and Paradise Regained as a whole, were, for me, quite hard to swallow. I found the more human elements of the poem to be its most intriguing. Milton paints Adam and Eve as quintissentially human characters who possess many of the same feelings that we all share:  joy, happiness, fear, sadness, depression, and, most of all, the overriding paramount importance of love. The act of Adam, who was not himself [evil], eating of the apple so that he could follow Eve, no matter what doom was to befall her and them, out of love for her, is still one of the most touching moments in all of literature -- as Mark Twain, in the voice of Adam, later said, ""Wheresoever Eve was there, THERE was Eden."" God, Satan, and the various angels are also endowed with human characteristics; most Christians today seem to have forgotten that God created Man ""in His own image"", and that He is not a perfect creature. Likewise, Satan is not entirely evil -- certainly he is ambitious and narcissistic, but so are many humans -- indeed, many have seen him as the hero of the poem (an errorenous view, as I see it.) God often comes off as extremely cold and hardly forgiving or merciful; indeed, to many readers, myself included, this poem doesn't come anywhere near its stated goal of justifying the ways of Gods to men, but only reinforces the views we already had (Mark Twain, whom I have previously mentioned, has a very different view of the situation, closer to my own perspective, that is worth seeking out.) Whatever one's objections to the theology and theodicy expressed within the poem, the poem remains a great work of literature -- poetic, grandiose, profound, extremely readable, and thought-provoking. The shorter sequel, Paradise Regained, is also included in this edition. This work, in my view, comes nowhere near the glory of it's predecessor, but it is still a good read and it is very handy to have it included in this volume as well. For that reason, I highly reccommend picking up this particular edition of the works; also because the introduction, written by Dr. Susanne Woods, is very good, and it has notes provided by the wonderful Christoper Ricks, who also edited the poem for this version. Unlike many editors, he does not include so many notes that they become cumbersome and distract from the text:  they are genuinely helpful and there are not too many of them. This is an absolute classic not only of English literature, but of world literature, and a monument in the tradition of epic poetry that you owe it to yourself to read",1

He then goes on to discuss the design process and he makes important distinctions between concious and unconcious design.  Notes on Synthesis and Form are the foundation for Alexander's work on design patterns.  This is the must read book before spending time on these other works.For the practioner, this book provides a powerful and applicable framework for addressing problems in multiple disciplines.",1

"943","The Greatest Novel","The Reviewers above and below warn that the novel is difficult to read.  If you a person of average intelligence, all you need is a character list and a careful reading and you will have absolutely no problem finding your way through the greatest novel ever written.  (It's an incredibly easy read the second time around.)  The Sound and the Fury is a summation of Faulkner's works.  Everything that is done in the rest of his novels was first done in The Sound and the Fury.  The Sound and the Fury is poignant and tragic.  It is monumental in its mythical power.  It is Southern and yet it is universal.  It is Faulkner's triumph as a novelist.  It is a study of human consciousness, perception, and existence.  The novel follows the decline and eventual fall of the Compson family.  In Faulkner's world of Yoknapatawpha County, the Compsons and Sartorises, the Sutpens and de Spains, in other words, the established old families of Jefferson declined as the invasive and unethical Snopes, portraits of the modern businessman, ascended to power.  The story is an intimate portrayal of the Compsons, and yet it is a symbolic and mythical account of decline and tragedy.  Why is it the greatest novel ever written?  It takes the innovations in narrative technique as developed by Joyce and Woolf in the movements of European Modernism (which it does better and with more purpose than Joyce and Woolf) and combines them with an exploration of storytelling and an intense devotion to a portrayal of place and region.  The story is great and moving.  The characters are loveable, hateable, tragic, and intensely vivid.  The place is conceived and presented with taxing reality.  The language, as with all of Faulkner's novels, is at times soaring and at times quite terse.  The structure is perfectly balanced and symbolically paired with the passion of Christ (the three days are Good Friday, Holy Saturday, and Easter Sunday).  In short, it is the paradigmatic example of what literature can (and should) do; even the greatest of literary feats stand in its shadow",1

"725","The Source for True Armanen Runelore","Guido von List was the leader of the Armanen-Orden, the single most important magical order of the 20th century. This book deserves to be on every thinking Germanic Heathen and Magician's bookshelf...  Many of List's ideas influenced the most important thinkers of the modern Heathen revival, including Edred Thorsson...The Armanen-Orden still survives in Germany, and von List's Futhork is no less powerful today than it was when it was revealed to him in 1903. In English speaking lands the Knights of Runes continues his tradition.BUY THIS BOOK",1
"159","Two books in one! First covers networking. Second covers three types of small businesses and Internet marketing.","What a wonderful book this author has written. It talks about developing interpersonal skills, public speaking skills, prospecting skills, networking etiquette, sales skills, marketing principles, and even customer service. It mentions the power of the Thank You note, and of giving more than you receive. It also devotes a chapter on some things about home-based businesses. And a chapter about the opportunities available through network marketing, and also a chapter on mail order and direct marketing as a business opportunity. I'm not sure the mail order chapter should have been included. Quite frankly, I think the author should have written another book about what he discusses in chapters 12 to 14 instead of including those chapters here. And I think Chapter 15 should have been saved for its own book, and not included in this book either. But who cares! Anybody interested in the main thrust of the book (endless referrals) is going to be interested in chapters 12 to 15 - and they are well written and informative.What I liked the most about the book was the chapter summaries at the end of each chapter. I did not have to wade through the book the first time through. I just had to read the summaries. The other thing that was really nice about the book was the ""recommended reading"" sections at the end of chapters 12 through 15 and the one at the end of the book. Those booklists were very thorough and helpful. 5 stars",1
"820","Made my son a reader!!","Usually it's a struggle to get my 10 year old son to read.  He could not put this book down and has spent the last few days reading it aloud to me and citing different stories.  Now he wants me to look for similar books.  A success!",1
"356","Can't Read Again","I love this book!  I love this series and it absolutely pains me to think that this may be the last (I say maybe because originally Buddies was supposed to be the last).  It is such a difficult book to pick up and read because every emotion invested in the previous three books is tested.  My love for Dennis Savage's irony becomes sorrow at the hope that he will lose face and stay with Little Kiwi.  My love for Little Kiwi's innocence becomes concern for his actions.  It's like watching your child make questionable decisions and knowing that no matter what the result, the choices that they make are theirs, and there's nothing you can do about it, but let them be chosen.  It's hard letting Little Kiwi grow up and become Virgil Brown.  I imagine it's the same way with a child, but at least then you get to see what happens!  Mind you, the book like the other three is a comic genius with subtle, feeling humor that has you laughing one minute and crying the next.  But just like ""Just Above My Head"" by James Baldwin (which I highly recommend), I have been unable to pick up this book and read it again.  It simply leaves me realing with so many feelings, yet I would not trade the experience reading it with anything.  How does one mix merriment with malaise so well?  Read the book and find out",1
"95","Actually 4 1/2 stars","Don't get me wrong this was a really good book.  And I am so close to giving it 5 stars.  It was just a little too short for me.  The story invloving the ball game was great and showed why baseball is so pure at its core.  The only thing that was lacking in the story was the story outside of the game.  You will fly through this book, it is a good story and you will feel satisfied after reading it, even after that mild short coming I mentioned.  Just my opnion, I could be wrong",1
"508","A Classic!","It is quite rare that a book appears that is this good; but this book is so good that even men (I am male) can (i.e. should) enjoy it. A groundbreaking, unabashedly feminist (wo)manifesto, The Vagina Monologues has given voice to countless women in the past ten years, and has ushered in a new era of sexual liberation.

"832","Useful insights from Dell's direct sales success story","If you are in the computer business, or in sales, you already know the Dell story. It's about a driven man, Michael Dell, who came up with a simple idea - direct sales - and then expanded his company into the world's second biggest manufacturer of personal computers. Dell's personal story is inseparable from the story of his company, and his book gives readers his unfiltered, first-person perspective. He covers his company's history, challenges, problems and successes in an unvarnished, matter-of-fact style. We highly recommend this book to anyone in the computer industry, to entrepreneurs and to managers who want to make their small businesses grow",1
"47","Wonderful ""Wizard of Oz""","I was a reasonably big fan of the ""Wizard of Oz"" when I was a kid. I'd seen the Judy Garland film, the ""Return to Oz"" film, my parents had taken me to a theatre production, and there used to be a cartoon series about Dorothy and her friends that I quite liked. Here in Australia, though, you don't see an awful lot of the Wizard of Oz books, and I missed out on all that as a kid. I managed to find a copy just recently of the the original story, and I really liked it. It's really a shame I couldn't find it earlier.Dorothy is a girl who lives with her aunt and her uncle in the countryside of Kansas. In the midst of a ""cyclone"", Dorothy, her dog Toto, and her whole house are swept away to the Land of Oz, a beautiful but strange world full of all sorts of interesting creatures, good and bad witches, and a very famous wizard. Dorothy tries to find her way home, and on the way makes many new friends, like the Scarecrow, ""Tin Woodsman"" and the cowardly lion. Will she ever make it home?It's rather different to the movie, I found. For one, the journey Dorothy and her friends go on takes many days, whereas the in the Judy Garland film it seems to all take place much shorter. The magic shoes Dorothy picks up in Oz are silver here, and not ruby red like in the film. There are also a lot of other creatures and things in the book, like the queen of the mice, the Hammerheads, and the Dainty China people. Though the world of Oz seems pretty big in the film, it feels a lot bigger to me in the book. Oz has a nice atmosphere too, I thought. It's very cosy and familiar, and kind of evokes a kind of America the way that say C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien evokes a kind of Britain, if that makes any sense. North, south, east, west... in Oz's every direction there's a new land to explore. You never know who you might meet, or how they'll do things there. I quite like how laid back everyone is in Oz. The way the Munchkins and the people of the Emerald City speak, for instance.I enjoyed finding out things about my favorite characters too, like how the Tinman became made of tin and how the flying monkeys became slave to the wicked witch of the west, which is all described here. That reminds me, there is a little bit of fairy tale violence here, but nothing worse than you might find in ""Little Red Riding Hood"".All in all, a great read, I thought. Whimsical, colourful and fun. I do hope I can get my hands on some of the follow up books. Good thing there's amazon",1
"979","Her ideas are classic, yet fresh","As a professional bridal consultant, I keep an extensive library of wedding related books on hand to help my brides design their own weddings.  Ms. McBride's Bridal Flowers is one of my favorites.  It is full of wonderful ideas - not just the traditional ""must have"" wedding flowers such as bouquets & boutonnieres, but the out-of-the-ordinary (but inspiring) boas, decorated lampposts & gilded calla lilies.  Ms. McBride shows that flowers are for more than just being carried or worn.  The large color photos are fantastic.  So many other books have little or no photos, or hand drawn diagrams that leaves the reader wondering.  Ms. McBride's book lets you see exactly what she is talking about.  It doesn't claim to be a how-to book, but perfect to take along when visiting your floral designer",1
"423","ENJOYED THIS THIRD OF THE SERIES AS MUCH AS THE FIRST","The story of Anne continues with this work and the author stays true to her style, story line and character developement.  This, like the other books in this series, have a rather timeless nature about them and a comforting charm.  The reader, of course, must remember the time they were written and the style and syntax used at that time.  From my own point of view, this is great.  I enjoy this type of writing and certainly enjoy Ms. Montgomery's story telling abilities.  In this work, Anne goes off to Redman College and her adventure continues.  Recommend these books for readers of all ages.  Wish there were more works out there like it.",1

"16","Highly Satisfying Novel, Despite the Blood and Guts","While expertly crafted, this is not a pretty novel, nor is it gentle.  The subject matter -- abduction of a child -- is somber, as are a few gruesome descriptions of death and dying.  The plot twists and turns, as befits a LeHane novel, and one way or another this complicated story finds its way to a denouement which the reader may not find satisfying. But you can usually trust Lehane to take good care of you in this, one of his finer books.  And not only are there plot twists to wrestle with, there are more than a few serious moral issues that will have you squirming or at least scratching your head.  All in all, this was a solid, enjoyable thriller.  The reader will feel his time was not wasted",1
"435","Columbus Cubes or bust!","Although not as fascinating as his PAPER CRYSTALS (a stellar work of modular origami), MATHEMATICAL ORIGAMI is a very solid work on the topic.  David Mitchell again gives clear instructions in text and diagrams for a very intriguing branch of paperfolding.  There are many books on geometric and modular origami, but Mitchell's are more than just ""look at this neat design.""  Instead, they are well thought out and very intelligently written.  A must-have for fans of the art",1
"667","Fun Reading and great characters","This was my first Julie Garwood novel and it was very good. I thoroughly enjoyed this authors descriptive characterization. The playful bantering had me laughing uncontrollably and falling in love with the characters even more with every page I read. With all the other reviews, I don't need to explain the plot. It isn't anything new for the romantic suspense genre, but very entertaining and an enjoyable read. It has mystery, intrigue, suspense, action, and romance. What more can a reader want?Is it worth the money?  Definitely. Can't wait to read more.",1

"487","Surprisingly Helpful!","I was forced to read this book for my graduate studies and I found it surprisingly helpful.  By filling out a basic personality inventory, this book will tell you what ""style"" of worker you are and then how to deal with people of other ""styles.""  I see this book being a hit with sales people who have to interact with many other people everyday.  But I can also see how this book could provide a foundation for learning how to work with other people in any environment.  If you are willing to make slight modifications to your personal behavior, this book gives you the skills to build great relationships.  I agree, however, with the previous reviewer's comments that this book does not go very deep, thus only 4 stars. Do not expect to change your boss into a nice guy just by reading this, but you can make your day-to-day dealings with him more enjoyable using these tactics.  (This is also an easy read... Took me 2 days!",1

My mother said it was the only thing that made her laugh out loud during her double knee replacement rehab!  I am giving this book to all my friends this year.",1
"113","How not to murder your wife","A fraudulent marine biologist, whose wife is about to expose his cover-up of phosphate pollution of the Florida Everglades, tries to kill her by throwing her overboard from a cruise ship.  Unknown to him she survives and haunts him to punish him. It's a wonderfully comic page-turner, although the plot runs out of steam towards the end and the practical jokes played on the would-be murderer become repetitious. A few ends are left loose. It challenged comparison with the Florida novels of Elmore Leonard, such as ""Maximum Bob"" and ""Stick"" but it does not quite live up to the master. Some of the humor contrasting weird and wacky Floridians with stolid Upper Midwesterners seemed to derive from David Barry (and Euripides, Ovid and Tasso used the maiden-rescued -from-sea-monster gimmick).I thought this was his best since ""Striptease."" The intervening ones have been too incoherently plotted and (although I'm a tree-hugging whale- lover myself) overloaded with environmentalist politics.  Incidentally, isn't releasing alien snake species into the wild an environmental no-no? ",1

My mother reported that Dr. Streicher's book had information on topics she couldn't find elsewhere -- even about laparoscopic procedures which she hadn't heard about before.  Dr. Streicher's book helped educate my mother so that she was an informed patient and knew what questions to ask her own doctor.  Fortunately, it was determined that my mother did not need to have a hyesterectomy.  My only problem with this book is getting my copy back from my mother.  I may need to purchase a new one.  I think it is a ""must-have"" for any woman 40+ -- even for men whose partners/spouses/girlfriends are facing this",1
"563","Excellent and entertaining stories that illuminate essential spiritual truths","I like most of Jack Kornfield's work and this book is no exception.  It has a lot of good stories that are very entertaining and each of them illuminates important spiritual truths.  The focus of this book is on misconceptions about enlightenment and samdhi experiences.  Also, it contains some beautiful accounts of samdhi experiences taken from various religious traditions.  There is a lot of practical wisdom in this book about finding meaning on the spiritual path and in life in general.  Jack Kornfield dispels the illusion we are ever a finished product or that our various personality quirks will ever disappear completely.  In one section, he quotes Ram Dass who once was asked, did you get rid of all your personality problems and he replied, ""no.. but I've become a connoisseur of my neurosis.""  In another section, Jack talks about vocation or purpose in life.  I found this to be particularly well done and personally meaningful.  While the book is good, I think you may get more out of the audio CD because you get to hear the tone of his voice and inflections.  I think this carries a part of the communication that doesn't come across in his books.My favorite taped work by Jack Kornfield is your Buddha Nature.  This is on the 10 paramitas (perfections) and I think it represents his most poignant expression of his thinking on life.  If you like After the Ecstasy, the Laundry... you may want to consider purchasing this as well",1
"837","Incredibly Useful!","As a prospective college student, I have to tell you how much I appreciate Students' Guide to Colleges. It combines many of the best features of the Princeton Review and Fiske guides with much more comprehensiveness. I also appreciate that it is without any trying-to-sound-hip blather because these are not editor-interjected profiles, they're written by actual students. This is a great compliment--I have been looking at colleges seriously for about a year, and this is the best guide to colleges among the many I've seen. I also just read the Oberlin College profile in this book with an Oberlin alum and relative. She said that this was this most comprehensive and accurate Oberlin portrayal she's read in a guide. Among other things, she and I loved the different student perspectives and the unthinkable-in-previous-guides questions like ""what aspect of your school would a prospective student not see on a college tour?"" The guide's honesty also impressed me, as the Fiske guide lauded Vassar's ""diversity,"" for example, where Students' Guide admits ""Although Vassar likes to talk about diversity a lot, most students are actually wealthy and white."" I am confident in saying that anyone applying anywhere from Hampshire to Harvard will find this book incredibly useful!! -Josh",1
"579","Another excellent book by Connelly","A very good crime fiction book. Connelly fans should buy this book without any hesitation if you don't have it already. Why it's good?1) Connelly is very good at creating 3 dimensional, believable, realistic characters and this book is no different.2) A very realistic behind the scene look in the inner workings of a police department, he's supposed to have been a crime beat writer.3) Logical plot. His books are not as fast flowing or edge of the seat exciting or scary as some thrillers, but they can't be if they are crime fiction. Rather, he takes you through the investigation step by step, going through the process that his detectives go through so you can see how they solve the crime. Cons: The only con I have is that the books are somewhat noir (I'm plagarizing this word from some other review). The thing is, Bosch is not your spiffy ""yes sir"", toe the blue line cop. And so, even though you want Bosch not to stir the pot and just get on with his detecting he does his best to sabotage his position in the force and your wishes, well, c'est la vie, apparently Connelly likes to put angst in his readers' lives.I'm not going to spoil the book, if you must know what the book is about you can read the intro. All I'm trying to get across is why this book is good. A must buy",1
"859","Doesn't flow, but...eh, who cares!","I've gotten through about 1/3 of the book and I'm highly amused.  The first 50 pages are muddled and rather pointless so far.  However, I've laughed my way through them.  One thing Eco has is a very sophisticated sense of humor.  If you enjoy a mental challenge and writing that's loaded with wit, I'd suggest picking up this book.  I never knew there were four kinds of people before: morons, fools, lunatics and cretins.

"646","Contentment","I too have stood at the dessert table of a buffet hopelessly unable to eat as many servings as I wanted.  This is a perfect metaphor for the book ""When All You've Ever Wanted Isn't Enough"".  The book is about the spiritual yearning you feel inside, that always seems to want something more.  Until they arrive at that ""something more"", people can never truly feel content.As is the case with most of Kushner's writing, he uses a book of the old testament to further his explanation. In this case, he effectively employs the seemingly paradoxical book of Ecclesiastes.  This book of the Bible finds its author searching for more in life.  In the end, the author finds that it is not so much the end as the journey itself that has importance.  Kushner's overall point is best summarized on page 189.  Does it make a difference if I am honest, good, or faithful?  It does not seem to matter to my bank account or fortune.  ""... It matters if we are true to ourselves, to our innate human nature that requires things like honesty and kindness and grows flabby and distorted if we neglect them.  It matters if we learn how to share our lives with others, making them and their world different, rather than try and hoard life to ourselves.  It matters than we learn to recognize the pleasures of every day, food and work and love and friendship, as encounters with the divine, encounters that teach us not only that God is real but that we are real too.""  It is a simple yet beautiful message.  People that live this message will certainly discover the beauty in their life",1
"854","Think while laughing !","A really great book by a great man.  I almost laughed out loud while on a train and am sure people thought I was crazy. The book made me wonder how can you lead such an interesting life and yet win a Nobel Prize in physics (I guess you can). Though the book does not follow a chronological order , I could feel the earlier part corresponds to the youthful times in his life (If he ever got old). Towards the later stages in the book I could also sense some cynicism in his words and he feels strongly about the lack of integrity, particularly in scientific research and life in general around him. A wonderful book that gives some insight into a brilliant mind and inspires to think while learning and not just memorize facts.",1

"10","Beautifully written, heartwarming story","This story captivated me right from the outset, as Vivian copes with age-related loss of memory. Her scenes are tenderly drawn in sensitively described and insightful detail, and she is a very realistically portrayed. As Susannah packs up her childhood home and prepares to move Vivian into an assisted living apartment, she uncovers clues to her past concerning the mysteries of her brother's death and whereabouts of her long-lost high-school sweetheart. With just the right blend of drama, action, suspense and resolution of family issues, this enjoyable story is very uplifting and thought-provoking, providing reflections for my own midlife crisises. It is easily read within a couple of hours, and there is a subtle tie-in to the Blossom Street books, leaving the possibility that these likable characters may reappear in subsequent books in that series.

"629","Best Treatment of Strategic Planning for Churches","I've read some of the negative reviews listed for this title, and I must strongly disagree.  Malphurs' work here is the best treatment of strategic planning for churches I have found to date.  In place of the term ""advanced"" in the title, a better word would be ""comprehensive.""  Nonetheless, Malphurs here provides a handbook addressing church planning that is unrivaled today in breadth and insight.As a pastor of twenty years, I wish this book had been available when I first started in ministry.  I hope this title is now offered in many seminaries, because its content would be a gold mine for young, soon-to-be church leaders.  Pastors, church staff members, and lay leaders, this volume is a must-have.  In my opinion, it is required reading for anyone involved in church leadership",1
"297","Very useful but a little dated","I am a professional photographer, and I was looking for a book on lighting technique - which this book supplied excellently.Their step by step approach is easy to follow and understand, and all explainations have images attached so you can see what they are talking about.They slowly build your general knowledge on how light works rather than supplying specific lighting diagrams, allowing (and suggesting that you do) you to adapt the knowledge to your own use. They then go into more detail with difficult lighting subjects such as metal, glass, and more, and how to deal with them.My only complaint is that the book is starting to feel a little old, especially when they talk about colour. It is almost exclusively film based with virtually no reference to digital technology. If they were to do an updated version with more emphasis on lighting for digital, I would provide 5 stars",1

"879","Great Account of Sports and Social History","Rather than reading a biography of Red Auerbach, Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell, turn to this period book! Here you get everything: a complete portrayal of the situation of African American who were just starting to segregate professional sports outside of the Brooklyn Dodgers. But at the same time it is an introduction to a time, when athletes were not the superstars of today.On top of that, you get enough biographcal information on Russell and Chamberlain, but also on Cousy, Auerbach and many others. The book is very well written and starts right with information, no tedious introduction to plough through",1
"932","Life in Old Plymouth","In this study Demos examines family life as it was for the Pilgrims who came over on the Mayflower, before they joined with the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The book is in three main sections: the physical setting (housing, furnishings, and clothing); the structure of the household (family connections, including servants); and individual development (childhood, coming of age, and old age). The most striking thing is how all aspects of communal life were controlled by the Court: although laws were not draconian, they spelled out how one was to conduct his or her life pretty thoroughly. Mess up and you would be punished. But it's also true that people were not that different back then, either: parents still cared for their children and worried about their futures by making provisions for them; families were at the core of society's welfare; even women were given rights denied them in the mother country. It's interesting that even these first settlers saw the American continent as a vast area just waiting to be colonized, and one of the biggest problems facing the authorities was how to keep settlers from wanting to spread out too far from Plymouth itself, thus weakening communal ties. A highly recommended book",1
"7","To the point and beautifully Illustrated","This the one book that taught me more about how to use my SLR than the camera's manual itself. The step by step approach and the logical arrangement of chapters makes it a book that really teaches you photography. I also liked the way Mr. Frost uses two photographs to illustrate a filter. One take without the filter and then the same one with a filter.  Also explained very well is how longer lenses reduce depth of the photograph and small helful tips on increasing your depth of field.  An encompassing book, the last few chapters tell about how a slide show can be made more interesting and how to take care of your equipment.  The peppering of photos and illustrations make you want to go out and take pictures using the methods shown. A good buy and money well spent. My only gripe is that I preffered the smaller size of the previous edition as it fit easily in my kit bag",1

"245","AND THIS IS PRESIDENTIAL MATERIAL!","Every page is an eye opener.  The author has done an excellent job revealing the side of Hillary that has so long been hidden. I think America could do better by picking a different first woman president. Someone with some morals and a love of our country. She has neither. It is an important ""first"" that should withstand the test of time. Historians are going to have a field day writing all the trash these two are involved in. Her mothering skills reveal a great deal about her character. Her child was always placed last. The only time Hillary showed any family unity was when it was necessary for the media to put her in a positive light.How did these two gain so much wealth in such a short amount of time?  They did not even own property when ""they"" became president.  There are still a lot of questions to be answered, and many more books to be written about this family. 8 years of these two is quite enough. ",1

"219","A better title might be: ""A Truly Great American's Life""","As one of America's greatest presidents, Ronald Reagan will certainly be studied by historians for years to come and, like Abraham Lincoln he will likely be revered and discussed by people of all nationalities for many generations.  This book and his earlier autobiography, Where's the Rest of Me, will surely be the touch stones for any such inquiries and discussions.  This work, An American Life, however, will be of primary importance since it addresses his entire life and political career rather than simply the earlier part of his life, during which time he was primarily a sportscaster and actor.  For anyone who had the pleasure of listening to Reagan's political commentaries on the radio, or hearing him speak as Governor of California or as President of the United States, the book will be particularly enjoyable; for it is written in the easy-going conversational style that Reagan used in life.  What makes the book even more interesting is that you can not only catch a glimpse of the country into which Ronald Reagan was born but also see how that country was transformed into the nation as we know it today.  You may also observe that the problems of Reagan's day are not much different than those we face today.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand Ronald Reagan, how his many faceted character was formed, the inner workings of his mind, and the actions which led to his monumental achievements.  In my view, it would benefit the country greatly if this book was made to be required reading for every American child. ",1

"533","Blix couldn't take the candy from a baby -- just too kind.","""Disarming Iraq"" is Hans Blix's thought-provoking and historically-important memoir of the few but critical months leading up to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, during which he tried to paint a clear picture -- for the UN and the world -- of his inspection team's findings, claiming no need for urgency and lobbying for diplomacy.  The polarized atmosphere was palpably tense: while the U.S., the UK and Spain insisted that Iraq was not responding to inspections, France, Germany and Russia asserted with equal force that the inspection program had never been fully explored.   Parting the raging waters (for a few weeks, anyway) was the quintessential diplomat Hans Blix. As it reads, he was too diplomatic, unwilling to state his results confidently for fear that it might drive UN policy. It didn?t help that he had a few doubts of his own; that in spite of not finding any ""smoking guns"" in terms of banned weapons, he still sensed that Iraq was playing a cat-and-mouse game. Either the regime's odd narcissism allowed it to believe that it did not have to comply with the UN, or it was hiding something. Either way, Blix's hesitation was enough to set the stage for Colin Powell's historic February 5, 2003 presentation of evidence of WMD?s in Iraq, which was more or less the proverbial point of no return.  Apparently, what Mr. Blix was trying to tell us -- before he was drowned out by the noisy din of a fearful and overzealous media -- is now common knowledge about WMD?s in Iraq: Blix's commission failed to find anything not because the Iraqis succeeded at hiding the weapons, moving them ahead of inspections, but because the weapons really weren?t there. Iraq had disarmed at the end of the Gulf War in 1991, just as they?d claimed. The UN inspection program had worked -- without knowing it.  So how did the war move forward under false pretenses? According to Blix, ""a deficit of critical thinking"" was to blame. He speculates that our Congress would never affirm the use of force merely to end a reign of terror (even though Blix himself wishes for a UN resolution against brutal dictatorships). The Bush administration had to justify war in Iraq by linking it to terror, and since there was no real link, it had to capitalize on the ""theoretical"" link of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.  This is as far as his speculation goes. Where the phrase ""military industrial complex"" would seem most natural and expected -- followed by a salacious tell-all about Bush, Cheney and nefarious links to Saudi oil -- Blix cleverly sidesteps the issue of America's impatient itch for war by feigning ignorance. Giving Blix the benefit of the doubt, perhaps he prefers to be thought of as naive and not sensational.  Needless to say, Dr. David Kelly's death (the British scientist who leaked to the BBC that the British government had ""sexed up"" a document alleging Iraq's nuclear capabilities) was an ""unfortunate suicide"" -- and not the work of a shadow government. (The entire document, by the way, turned out to be a forgery.)  At least Blix observed the ""horse trading"" (""intense economic and diplomatic pressures"") our government used to obtain votes from other countries -- votes needed to pass the UN resolution authorizing the use of force -- as well as he disapproved the Bush administration?s spying on UN delegations while on their diplomatic visits to New York. Blix had other objections to U.S.-led efforts, but they are all based on facts and evidence, and are in defense of IAEA (a previous inspection organization, also headed by Blix) and UNMOVIC (the UN's Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission).  Interestingly, the largest setback to diplomacy was related to a 167-page ""cluster"" document released by Blix in early March of 2003, which summarized all the inspections for the three preceding months. Unfortunately for France and Germany, American and British members of UNMOVIC leaked pre-release draft copies of the document. In other words, France and Germany had much less time to prepare their official reactions to the cluster document than their British and American counterparts. Their positions, in favor of renewed inspections, were not as compelling.  While Blix?s passion is definitely enough to carry his memoirs, one can easily see why it was so difficult for Americans to take Mr. Blix seriously: he lacks that forcible personality that commands respect. Even so, he is gifted with an even temperament, a good sense of humor, and a deeply-imbued sense of integrity, all important qualities for diplomacy. Although he may have been the only individual capable of peaceably bridging the large gap between the UN and Iraq, in retrospect it may have been asking too much from some of our leaders to match Blix?s diplomatic efforts in their reasonableness and patience",1

"276","--Powerful and Unforgettable--","GODS AND GENERALS is an extremely well done and fascinating book.  The author, Jeff Shaara, did an excellent job of interpreting the characters. His task was a difficult one because his father's book, THE KILLER ANGELS is a classic in the chronicles of Civil War stories.  This book precedes the one written by his father. GODS AND GENERALS takes the reader to the beginning of the Civil War and through many of the battles. The major players in the story are Winfield Scott, Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Winfield Hancock and Lawrence Chamberlain.  The career biographies of these famous men were striking.  After reading of their early lives and service experiences, it gave me a better understanding of just how horrible a civil war was to all of these men who had formerly served together in the Union Army. They were an outstanding group of soldiers and the sadness that they all faced was to go to war against fellow soldiers and friends.I listened to the unabridged books on tape version read by Dick Estell.  He brought the characters to life by his narration. This book is well worth the time and truly is an unforgettable part of our history.",1
"614","what happened in the Middle???","I just finished reading the Hitorian. The first 400 pages were so compelling, that I could hardly put it down. Then..... it became soooo boring. It literally took me the same amount of time to get through the next 200 pages as the first 400. I just had to keep putting it down and shaking my head, thinking this has to get better, considering how good the first 2/3rd's were.I also have to say that I was disappointed with the ending - it was way too contrived for me... SPOILER ALERT*** - I found it EXTREMELY unbelievable that Dracula would 'assume' that Helen died in the fall and not gone after her, as the author states when Helen is recounting how she made it out alive from the fall. I mean, come on... Dracula is supposedly all knowing and has tracked this woman all over the world. Now were supposed to believe that he simply says ""damn, she fell - I guess after all I've been through, I won't bother to check - I'll just find another victim"" - sorry, didn't buy it and it really was a big let down after so much potential in the beginning..Overall, the book was really great. Fascinating reading for the Dracula fan. Just wish the ending held up to the beginning.",1
"510","The Nostradamus Code","With the hype over the Da Vinci Code and its related popularity, you can sometimes get the feeling that some people probably think the grand conspiracy novel started with Dan Brown.  Of course, this is not the case, as Brown is merely one in a long line of such thriller writers.  Probably the biggest in the bunch was Robert Ludlum, but not to be forgotten is Jon Land.  Not quite the big name that Ludlum or Brown, Land is nonetheless the most pure fun, with outlandish plots and tons of action.The Last Prophecy brings back Danielle Barnea, an ex-Israeli cop and Ben Kamal, a former Palestinian detective.  Despite the obvious conflicts caused by their different backgrounds, the two are faithful lovers and, as the novel begins, both working as investigators for the U.N.  In this case, the two are called to look into a mass murder in a Palestinian village.  At first, it appears to be a massacre by Israeli troops, but it soon enough appears to be something far more sinister, a conspiracy tied to events uncovered at the World War II and some lost prophecies of Nostradamus.  The last of these prophecies provides the key to the conspiracy.Land uses his standard formula for his Barnea/Kamal novels:  the two split up for the majority of the book to separately unearth parts of the plot only to converge at the end to stop the bad guys.  Typically, the people who provide the information are assassinated by the villains before they can reveal all.  This formula works well enough since Land executes it well (and really, Brown and Ludlum use a similar formula themselves).I won't say this is perfect writing, but it's plenty good enough to merit a strong four stars.  My biggest ""problem"" with Land is that he is only writing books featuring Barnea and Kamal; I miss his older novels with Blaine McCracken, which were even more delightfully outlandish with their James Bond-like world conquest plots.  But in the absence of McCracken, this series still fits the bill for what Land does best: entertain from beginning to end.",1

"288","Remarkable work","""By a hypnotism that defies explanation--at least by a non-German--Hitler held the allegiance and trust of this remarkable people to the last.  It was inevitable that they would follow him blindly, like dumb cattle but also with a touching faith and even an enthusiasm that raised them above the animal herd, over the precipice to the destruction of the nation.""This remarkable book is based principally on the captured German documents, the interrogations and testimony at the Nuremberg trials of German military officers and civilian officials, the diaries and memoirs which some of them have left, and on Shirer's experience in the Third Reich.  Shirer became one of the most respected journalists in wartime Europe.The book is exhaustive and detailed with extensive notes and bibliography.  A bit of patience is needed to get through the dialect, often quoting Mein Kampf.  Shirer brings forth wonderful descriptions of the people who played a role in those troubled times.  The individual battles are not detailed, so one will need to refer to other sources for a more detailed look at these battles and horrors that ensued.  This is an important book for those interested in Germany and life in the Third Reich at this time. The Reich rises with a quick run through of Hitler's youth and the German history, then the politics and Hitler's megalomania that led to national socialism and the rise to dictatorship.  The Treaty of Versais and the fall of the mark lead to Germany's economic fall, allowing for the people to welcome in a dictatorship, a new messiah by deceit.  The military buildup could now begin.   The coups to overthrow Hitler and the Nazis had already failed and will continue to fail throughout the war.  For the officers it was either death by Hitler or death by fighting.  The massacres of the Russians began soon after the invasion of the East.  The French and other countries were also caught up in the massacre, and William gives us the eyewitness reports.  The ""Jewish cleansing"" started soon after the nazis took over their first countries. The Nazis kept developing more and more efficient means of extermination and experimentation.  There is an exhaustive lead up to the start of W.W.II, the invasion of Poland.  There was freighting information discovered on what would have been in store for Britain if invaded, not to mention the world and the slaughter of Russia.  The Nazi's pinnacle arrives at about 2/3 of the way through the book where the fall begins with the Allied advance.It took military action eventually to stop Hitler's ""New world order"", not the people.  The lack of doing anything to stop Hitler from walking into the Rhineland should not be forgotten.  Does not the blame fall partly on the people, Chamberlain, and the military generals?  Maybe if more would have read Mein Kampf, and not disregarded it's contents millions would not have lost their lives.  The Nazi propaganda took over the press, and soon indoctrinated the German people.  There were many opportunities to stop Hitler by France and Britain early on.  Have we not learned anything from the past?  Is there not a parallel in our country?""The Germans imposed the Nazi tyranny on themselves.""Hegel was one of the many influences on Hitler and Marx. Hegel and Marxism is still very much alive today in humanism, nationalism, ""supreme state"", racism,  and mysticism",1

I bought the book a few days ago, mainly because I like David Corn.  When I read it I was pleasantly surprised at how insightful it is.  I think along with the two books I mentioned earlier, this trio make up the essential reading on Bush, Iraq, and everything that can be encompassed in those broad categories.  If you could only read one, I would call it a dead heat between, ""Hubris,"" and, ""State of Denial.""  If pressed I suppose I would have to give the edge to Hubris, as the writing was much less tedious I thought.  ",1
"463","The Death of the Devastators","Many people remember the battle of Midway as the turning point of the war in the Pacific due to the sinking of four Japanese aircraft carriers, and rightly so.  But would the American success at Midway been possible without the heroic actions of their torpedo squadrons?  Probably not.  In this eye-opening account of the battle, author Alvin Kernan sheds much new light on these intrepid airmen who, flying obsoloete aircraft and using defective torpedoes, cleared the way for the SBD Dauntlesses to deliver the crushing blows on the Japanese carriers.After sighting the enemy carriers, the three American flattops began launching their torpedo bombers, dive bombers, and fighters in the hopes of making a coordinated attack on the Japanese fleet.  However, while en route to the target, almost all of the squadrons became separated and the USS Hornet's contingent of fighters and dive bombers never even made it to the Japanese fleet. Its aircraft either returned to the carrier or ditched in the sea.  Meanwhile, ,the planes from USS Yorktown and USS Enterprise were not able to coordinate their attacks.  Thus, the torpedo planes attacked without fighter protection.These planes were thrown into a virtual meat grinder of anti aircraft fire and pursuit from Japanese fighters.  Out of a compliment of 51 planes, 44 were shot down.  One man, Ensign George Gay, survived from Torpedo squadron 8.  Not a single American torpedo hit the Japanese fleet.  However, this sacrifice was not in vain, for a few minutes later, the SBDs found the Japanese and in the span of a few minutes sent three Japanese carriers to the bottom.  The fourth followed later in the day.The author brings up some interesting points in the book.  For example, he mentions the confusing flight plan of the Hornet's commander Ring, who, for some reason, chose to fly a course which would take him well north of the Japanese fleet.  He then failed to write an after action report upon returning to the Hornet.  The author also describes the inferiority of the American aircraft, specifically, there extremely limited range which, in the end, caused the American fighters to turn back.  Also, the fighters that did make it to the Japanese fleet never flew down to help out the lumbering Devastators.  In all intents and purposes, the SBDs happened to end up in the right place at precisely the right time.  If they had not, the battle could have turned out much differently.This is a fascinating book.  I've read several books about the battle of Midway, but none have went into the depth of exploring the destruction of the torpedo planes as this one does.  The writer, a former member of the Enterprise's air group, describes the battle as only a true eyewitness could.  He raises some alarming quetions which I had never thought about before reading this book.  Although the book itself is somewhat short, it does a masterful job of covering the plight of the torpedo planes.I highly recommend this fine book.  If you've read anything previously about the battle of Midway, you must read this book.  It sheds some new light on the heroic sacrifice of the American torpedo squadrons and how their actions paved the way for the American victory",1
"304","Swarm theory","The new economy is a global economy favoring intangible things: ideas, information, and relationships and is intensely interlinked.   Today, the new information based sector occupies over 15% of the total US economy.  In the postindustrial society, communication has become the economy and the cultural, technological, and conceptual impacts reverberate at the roots of our lives.   The financial sector has reshaped the economy; the financial sector ownership involves only a small number of people;  the financial innovations include: mortgages, insurance, venture funding, stocks, checks, credit cards, and mutual funds; the financial sector has given rise to corporations, market capitalism, the industrial age, and has influenced how all business has been done.  Since communication is the economy, the net is the future.  The net has accelerated in usage due to the increase in silicon chips and fiber optic data transmission; the net is weaving lives, minds, and artifacts into a global scale network; the result is the swarm of information, reticulating the surface of the planet; the new economy will increasing obey the logic of the networks and understanding the network will be the key to understanding how the economy works.  In 1997, there were 6 billion non-computer chips and by 2005 the predicted usage was at 10 billion.The network represents connectivity.  We are connection everything to everything.  The network values the dumb power of bits in the swarm; the connectivity and usage of the dumb bits or parts in the swarm yield smart results; and we don't need advanced Artificial Intelligence to make an intelligent system.   The network is a link of distributed, bottom up, data bits;   it lets things communicate among themselves and takes a decentralized approach for communication, for example, manufacturing robots scheduling their own work based on incoming requests, as they bid on work dependant on their capability.  The swarm aim is superior performance in a turbulent environment.  Consider the power of the ""Wisdom of the crowds"".  In one case sample, 5,000 attendees, at a computer graphics conference were give individual access to a simulator and the task on how too land a plane.  The attendee had novice knowledge about how to land the plane.   The jet responded to the average decisions of the swarm.  The group landed the jet with almost no direction.   In another case example, the group was given the task to navigate a submarine and go look for buried treasure.   The group could not initiate any movement until leadership from a loud speaker was given to ""go right"".  The leadership unlocked the paralysis of the swarm and the direction facilitated action.Technology success is measured on how invisible it becomes to the end user and how effective it becomes to the long term strategy in developing products and services that can't be ignored.   The power of the network increases in value n power 2 where n is the number of members.  Therefore, networks need to increase their critical mass of members to become effective.   Innovation attracts members.  Innovation is more important than price; price is the derivative of innovation; monopolies push up price and decrease quality and create a dangerous singular source of innovation; and the network destroys monopolies through collective innovation, such as, open source.",1

"433","Adventures of Huckleberry Finn- A Racial Controversy","The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has been argued as a racial controversy since the first day it was published. Shortly after it was accessible to the public, multiple committees banned the book, proclaiming it to be racist and ""trash"". To this day, Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is banned in several school districts. In my personal copy of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, there is a helpful and informative introduction and notes throughout the text written by Robert O'Meally. He clearly states that the intent of Twain's word usage is needed in order to properly and vividly describe the setting and tone of the book. His usage of the racial slur ""nigger"" can be seen as offensive, but I believe it was necessary for it to be realistic. The dialogue that Huckleberry uses throughout the book stays very true to his character, time, and place, at which the slur was used casually. Besides the usage of the word ""nigger"", characters in the book often loudly express their racist mentality.  In the begining of Chapter 14, Huck and Jim are talking about all sorts of topics, both of them speaking their mind. Twain describes Huck's thoughts: ""Well, he was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head, for a nigger."" Obviously some would perceive this to be intolerable and crude, yet I believe that Twain is simply describing the way Huck thinks of Jim. The growing friendship between Huck and Jim is the basis of the entire novel. The book depicts the way Huck feels and thinks about several ideas and concepts about life, the way he feels about his friend must be present and elaborate.I strongly support Mark Twain's the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The book wins people over with it 's dialogue, plot, originality, and capability to express a realistic story that takes place in a racist and unjust America.",1

"313","Hard hitting truths about the real world of work!","Imagine you're attending a career enhancement seminar and suddenly you're doused with a giant bucket of ice cold water. In essence, ""Fire Your Boss"" is just that. Stephen Pollan's discourse on the stark realities of the real world of work shatter all the hyperbole and fluff of ""careering"" in not just corporate America but any occupational arena. It's an easy, conversational and straightforward read that IMHO should be called ""Hire Your Boss"". Pollan, a life coach with the style, chutzpah and hubris of a Donald Trump/Scott Adams hybrid, elaborates on the criticality of taking care of your number one customer in the microeconomic marketplace-your boss. Pollan supports the essence of this approach with references to how the economic landscape has changed over the last few decades and how it's helped to perpetuate agency activity in organizations. Simply put, managers will continue to act purely out of self-interest rather than an alignment with organizational objectives. With this in mind, what will avail those of the non-management cadre the most is looking out for the needs of supervision, with more of a ""hired gun"" approach rather than that of a sycophant. Many of Pollan's precepts will at first seem counterintuitive--such as ""work for the money, the love will follow"" or ""lose your career, get a job"" and may come across as trite and cynical. However when taken in context the underlying schema is this: a job is a means of providing income-no more, no less. Trying to find personal fulfillment therein is a recipe for self-destruction. The author does a fine job of using the experiences of his clients to help illustrate these key concepts and concludes by offering a seven-step roadmap to help one achieve the empowerment and independence in the modern job market. Although Pollan drives across some salient points about the contemporary world of work he does tend to oversimplify a bit with regards to some management behavior. Furthermore, some of his coping strategies have the guise of tactics that only a New York Attorney could formulate. Wait-Pollan IS a New York Attorney. In sum, this is as an island of sanity in a sea of ""Be a Star at Work"" banter that perpetuates the dangling-carrot-over-the-sea-of-cubicles syndrome. Finally, when you boil this down you realize that one as an employee should consider themselves self-employed. I find it a good affirmation of what work really should be and a refreshing rebuttal to all the careering pundits whose success is predicated on the management's mystification of office life.Not for the faint of heart!",1

"856","Tremendous","Line by line, this book has some of the best writing I've seen in a while.  This is an amazing thing, since it's still very fast-moving and not at all overwritten.  The author just has an amazing eye for detail and a very crafty sense of humor.  The book surprised me constantly with its insights, and these characters were so real to me by the end that I missed them for a week.  I read Craig's first book, and it doesn't stand up to this at all.  It's exciting to see how much the writer has improved, and I can't wait for the next one",1
"526","This book won Thomas Mann a well-deserved Nobel Prize","After viewing the German artistic mini-series for television many years ago, I decided to read this German family story to rival Galsworthy's Forsythe Saga. I was not disappointed, because this book deals, among others, with one essential aspect of human existence: man's difficulty in adapting to hardships and changes in social status. The story of the Buddenbrooks is a story of moral values among individuals who, although belong to the same family, can be astonishingly different in their understanding of life and their grasp of reality. In this family we see characters who are able to adapt, understand the world and compromise, while at the same time we are exposed to those who are limited by their own upbringing to a life of limited flexibility and eventual disillusion and self-abandon. This fundamental book of world literature attacks two antithetic facets of human nature, two views of the world that are constantly at battle within all human beings. It is for this reason that ""Buddenbrooks"" is fundamentally an allegory about man and his internal turmoil with the major challenges of life, a carefully crafted story with psychological insight that makes the reading of this book definitely worthwhil",1
"148","Freedom, Freedom, Freedom!","Give up dieting forever! I have and I am now losing weight eating anything, yes anything, I want.  Can you imagine eating anything you want and not being frightened?  This is the book that will set you free, this is the book you need. Has it struck you that dieting is unnatural?  Don't eat this, don't eat that, count this, count that, measure this, measure that, I can't have this, and I can't have that, ad nauseum.  Which diet guru are you going to believe?  Can you reall stay with a low-carb diet or a high-carb diet or calorie counting the rest of your life?  Most importantly, do you want to stick to a restricted diet the rest of your life?  The first day of my new eating pattern I ate two meals.  The second day, I woke up with no hunger, no reactive hypoglycemia (nausea and shakes from hunger)!  What a miracle.  I have shifted to an apple for lunch and anything I want for dinner (I love to cook and desire to eat with my family).  At maintenance, I may end up eating two meals a day; I don't know and it certainly isn't something to ""worry"" about.  The diet gurus that say one meal will cause you to overeat later, etc., are wrong, wrong, wrong.  Maybe it sounds theoretically correct, but it does not work that way.  Listen, I have found out the less you eat, the less you eat.  I do eat to satisfaction at dinner and it does not stretch my stomach.  By the way, Dr. Dean Edell stated on his radio show that he only eats one meal a day himself.  He says there is NO scientific proof that X number of meals are better than one.  Also, I want you dear readers to know that I have four friends who are ""naturally"" slim (adult women - 30's and 40's). Two of them eat a small amount for lunch (like a small hamburger) and a good dinner (they are sizes 3 and 6).  One gal eats at 2:30 PM, a huge amount, and a snack at night (she is size 7).  One gal does nibble all day, like a potato chip here and there (no thank you, personally).  Oh, and a relative who is size 4 eats breakfast and dinner, never lunch.  Remember my comeback for sabotagers:  ""Slim people don't need much food, even if we exercise.  Who says a certain number of meals a day are better than one or two?""  The only negative thing I have to say about Diane's book is that I felt she took scripture out of context.  God fed the Israelites manna 2X a day; they were supernaturally filled and nourished.  He does not feed anyone manna today.  Also, biblical gluttony is not overeating (I do believe a lifestyle of overeating is sin, but not gluttony).  Biblical gluttony refers to the Roman-type parties where people overate, overdrank and went on to commit more sin.  On the positive side, I do believe Diane tries steer away from legalism and authoritarianism.  This book is an answer to prayer.  You won't be sorry if you buy this book",1
"907","The Struggle for Revolutionary Culture  ","Trotsky once wrote that of the three great tragedies in life- hunger, sex and death- revolutionary Marxism, which was the driving force behind his life and work, mainly concerned itself with the struggle against hunger. That observation contains an essential truth about the central thrust of the Marxist tradition. However, as Trotsky demonstrates here, Marxist methodology cannot and should not be reduced to an analysis of and prescription for that single struggle. Here Trotsky takes on an aspect of the struggle for mass cultural development.In a healthy post-capitalist society mass cultural development would be greatly expanded and encouraged. If the task of socialism were merely to vastly expand economic equality, in a sense, it would be a relativity simple task for a healthy socialist society in concert with other like-minded societies to provide general economic equality with a little tweaking after vanquishing the capitalism mode of production. What Marxism aimed for, and Trotsky defends here, is a prospect that with the end of class society and economic and social injustice the capacity of individual human beings to reach new heights of intellectual and creative development would flourish. That is the thought that underpins Trotsky's work here as he analyzes various trends in Russian literature in the immediate aftermath of the October Revolution of 1917. In short, Marxism is certainly not a method to be followed in order to write great literature but it does allow one to set that literature in its social context and interrelatedness. You will find no Deconstructionist or other fashionable literary criticism here. Quite the contrary. Here Trotsky uses his finely tuned skill as a Marxist to great effect as he analyzes the various trends of literature as they were affected (or not affected) by the October Revolution and sniffs out what in false in some of the literary trends. Mainly at the time of writing the jury was still out about the prospects of many of these trends. He analyzes many of the trends that became important later in the century in world literature, like futurism and constructivism, and others- some of which have disappeared and some of which still survive. The most important and lasting polemic which Trotsky raised here, however, was the fight against the proponents of `proletarian culture'. The argument put forth by this trend maintained that since the Soviet Union was a workers state those who wrote about working class themes or were workers themselves should in the interest of cultural development be given special status and encouragement (read a monopoly on the literary front).  Trotsky makes short shrift of this argument by noting that, in theory at least as its turned out, the proletarian state was only a transitional state and therefore no lasting `proletarian culture' would have time to develop. Although history did not turn out to prove Trotsky correct the polemic is still relevant to any theory of mass cultural development.One of the results of the publication of this book is that many intellectuals, particularly Western intellectuals, based some of their sympathy for Trotsky the man and fallen hero on his literary analysis and his ability to write. This was particularly true during the 1930's here in America where those who were anti-Stalinist but were repelled by the vacuity of the Socialist Party were drawn to him. A few, like James T. Farrell (Studs Lonigan trilogy), did this mostly honorably. Most, like Dwight MacDonald and Sidney Hooks, etc. did not and simply used that temporary sympathy as a way station on their way to anti-Communism. Such is the nature of the political struggle.A note for the politically- inclined who read this book. Trotsky wrote this book in 1923-24 at the time of Lenin's death and later while the struggle for succession by Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev was in full swing. While Trotsky did not recognize it until later (nor did others, for that matter) this period represented the closing of the rising tide of the revolution. Hereafter, the people who ruled the Soviet Union, the purposes for which they ruled and the manner in which they ruled changed dramatically. In short, Thermidor in the classical French revolutionary expression was victorious. Given his political position why the hell was he writing a book on literary trends in post-revolutionary society at that time.       ",1
"935","Great read - like James Fenmore Cooper -","I really enjoyed this work. Didnt know this guy won a Pulitzer but it figures. I was swept away by the imagery created by this master.

"332","For the Vicarious Adventurer","Cahill's writing is somewhat of an acquired taste. This is a compilation of outdoor stories which do not always seem self contained - some missing context, some missing closure. And they are not necessarily adventures in the conventional sense, as stories may focus on nature, archaeology, sociology, etc. While the book cannot be construed as an outdoor reference, there is good information (ex. ""wisdom"" of cave diving). Some stories hit the vicarious adventurer's sweet spot. The author is at his best in this book when relating his experience caving in Kentucky, engaging the reader with educational content (ex. barometric effect on air flow), spectacular descriptions(ex. lightening igniting bat guano), and hair raising suspense (ex. getting lost in a maze of passages). Not all of the stories held an equal level of interest for me, but they are short enough to peruse and ponder as time permits",1
"806","Ultra-high expectations unmet","I'm a little late in reading this book.  I am trying to pace myself between the movies and the books so that I can enjoy a little Harry Potter at least every year.    I think Goblet of Fire is the best in the series, so naturally it would be pretty difficult for Phoenix to live up to that standard.  In Goblet, it feels like Rowling had a fantastic ending in mind, and that drove the writing of the story.  In Phoenix, it seems like the story is key and the ending was simply tacked on to round it out and provide some concluding information.  The major theme seemed to be the Ministry's takeover of Hogwarts.  I found that entire thread to be thoroughly engrossing.  Harry's dreams, however, took on sub-plot status, and then rose to the top for the final conflict.    I didn't mind the length of the book, but it did seem to drag in a couple of places.  The gang spent too much time at Grimmauld Place.  I could have also done without Hagrid's giant story.    My biggest problem with the book was Dumbledore's secrecy.  Good stories have real roadblocks to keep the hero from achieving his/her goal.  In Phoenix, the cause for most of the confusion was that Dumbledore was reluctant to share certain information with Harry.  He explains his behavior in a most unconvincing way in the final pages.  The secrecy was necessary for the story to take the course that it did, but it lacked good motivation and left me feeling let down.  It reminded me of the natural disaster movie template where the world could be easily saved if not for an arrogant bureaucrat who refuses to listen to the young upstart with all the answers.  It is contrived conflict that is hardly believable.  Don't get me wrong.  I love the Harry Potter series.  And, perhaps my expectations have risen too high.  I am eagerly awaiting the movie and then I know I will devour book 6 (when I allow myself to read it).  I lose interest in most book series after the first couple of installments.  Harry Potter always leaves me wanting more",1
"980","Really the Last Prophet","This rare book details Aleister Crowley's ascension as the prophet of a new Aeon, the Aeon of Horus. Out of all the Aleister Crowley books in mass market format, this stood out in memory years after I read it as one of Crowley's most disturbing works. In fact, I questioned my new faith in Crowley's religion Thelema reading this book; this was for real and not a joke. After contemplating, I thought it would be worth it stick with this because witchcraft is now a cool thing amongst today's youth and Crowley was a famous early form of witchcraft as we know it today. This is serious stuff, I wouldn't mess around with this unless you are interested in the occult. It should be noted that real life ritual magick as described in these type of works really do work; I did a ritual from Necronomicon and Lesser Key of Solomon to help with a college Astronomy course- I got a respectable C grade when I close to failing with a D-. But be prepared for some harassment aboyt alleged satanism.",1
"235","Anything truly great is not for everyone...(a criticism of critics by a critic)","I recommend that most people do NOT read this book.  If you choose to ignore me and you read the work anyway, please first be remotely acquainted with and keep in mind a few things before you attempt to do so (and certainly before you try to express an ostensibly reputable opinion on Amazon): **magical realism**; Jewish history, religion, culture and humor(although the last is perhaps redundant); memory; folk lore; the English language; love; the nature of histories; sex; death; pain; narrative style and voice; the multiplicity of human, and likewise Jewish, experience; imagination.  I will assert, because I hope it is true, that you don't need to all of these things to enjoy ""Illuminated,"" but you do need to be familiar with some of it.  And you must be willing to spend some time with this book to enjoy it.  All those with self-diagnosed A.D.D. need not bother cracking the spine. However, even if you qualify despite the rigor of what may be required of you, everything may be indeed sadly ""obfuscated.""  Or perhaps less disappointingly, only partly obfuscated.  If so, don't get angry. Don't curse the gods or creative writing programs. And certainly, if you are going to write bad reviews on Amazon, preface it first with your own faults as a reader. Lastly, buck up.  Read another book.  Even the Bible (another little book high up on the best seller's list) is not for everyone.And for those of you out there who disagree to my approach with this review of ""Illuminated"", that is fine.  Dismiss it.  At least, please don't take the advice of any other critic here who speaks in an equally perturbed voice.  Moreover, don't read it for the reviews...Actually stop reading reviews. Now",1

"398","THE MARCH CONTINUES","I first read this extraordinary book in 1986, just two years after it was first published.  Picking it up again, I find it eerily applicable to our current situation. There is a familiar old adage that teaches us that those who refuse to learn history are doomed to repeat it. THE MARCH OF FOLLY brings this message back to the forefront.Barbara W. Tuchman eloquently discusses the bizarre propensity of governments throughout history to pursue policies contrary to their own interests. Mind you, this is not a pacifist book but rather one that begs governments to beware of the reckless pursuit of policy that might prove to be dangerous. And, yes, I admit right readily that hindsight is 20-20.Beginning with the Trojans and their acceptance of the Trojan Horse to benighted Papal policy during the renaissance to Britain's stupidity during the American Revolution to questionable American policy during the Vietnam war, THE MARCH OF FOLLY invites the reader to consider the fact that as things change in historic chronology apparently nothing else does.Given our current war policies, efforts and mistakes in Iraq, Tuchman's masterpiece is a very poignant read and we must confess, regardless of individual political leanings, that the potential for history to repeat itself yet again is considerable. Who knows, there may yet be a sequel to this one appropriately titled THE MARCH CONTINUES.THE HORSEMA",1

"841","A very responsible and important study","I would strongly recommend that anyone interested in this book read the review of this book by M. Goldin on H- Net.It is comprehensive and comes from someone who served in an Armed Forces combat unit during the Second World War.This book chronicles the negative and prejudiced attitudes held by various figures of the Army throughout the past century. These attitudes may have been  important in effecting the lives of individual soldiers at the unit level.They too may have had certain effect on overall U.S. policy in such matters as bombing the rail lines into Auschwitz. There were also efforts to influence negatively American attitudes towards the emerging Jewish state in Israel. This is in a way a sad and yet important book to read. It chronicles how that fundamental American ideal of equal treatment of the individual human being was violated by prejudice, and ignorance. ",1

"168","The Navajo Landscape","Tony Hillerman once again takes us into the world of the Navajo with Jim Chee and the legendary Joe Leaphorn of the Navajo Tribal Police. I read this for the first time some years ago, and this entry in the long-running series is very exciting. It has a lot of atmosphere and Leaphorn and Chee are fleshed out more than usual in this terrific read.Both Chee and Leaphorn are dealing with personal issues as this one begins. Chee hasn't quite figured out how he feels about Mary leaving him because he could not leave his Navajo way of life behind and move to the city with her. He is smitten with a pretty Navajo attorney named Janet but she's with someone else. Leaphorn meanwhile, is on terminal leave and retiring after the unexpected death of his beloved wife Emma. Niether he or Chee can explain his obsession with finding a missing pot hunter named Eleanor Friedman-Bernal. No Navajo would be involved, as stealing pots like this would make one a ""Thief of Time"" according to Navajo tradition.Chee's letting a rather large backhoe get stolen right from under his nose will have ties to Leaphorn's investigation, and once more Chee will be helping Leaphorn all across the Navajo territory. This one will stretch all the way into Utah and down the San Juan River. Leaphorn will be reminded of a young boy's death by drowning before this one wraps up, and it will have unexpected ties to his search for Eleanor.It seems Eleanor was looking for pots made by the Anasazi, a tribe that simply vanished from the face of the earth. Pictographs and petroglyphs of Kokopelli, the ""Watersprinkler,"" will play a vital part in this mystery. But Eleanor's interest is also anthropological, and someone thinks what she's discovered is worth killing for.Leaphorn and Chee will be hundreds of miles apart when they reach the same conclusion in this complex mystery. One will have to race to the other as things turn ugly, and two very different men will find commom ground when Leaphorn asks the unexpected of young Chee.Hillerman's descriptions of the thousand foot cliffs along the San Juan River at night, under a sky filled with Navajo mystery, will enthrall you. This is a good mystery and quite possibly the best in the series. You don't want to miss this one",1

"557","A quick, terrific read","  Once again, David McCullough's treatment of an american icon is the best of its kind. This biography reads like a fascinating novel, and McCulloughs narrative ability is unmatched. No one seems to be able to tell a story the way he can.   The great Theodore Roosevelt, known throughout the world and across the ages as an incredibly strong, tough, larger than life figure actually began as somewhat of a weakling. The book covers his total transformation from a sickly child to a man of great resolve and courage, the man who would become President of the United States.  Best of all is that McCullough likes and admires his subject. This is not always the case with biographies. Roosevelt and his family are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. Highly recommended, as are all of McCullough's books",1
"389","Perfect intoduction for the curious","Only about two hundred pages, Jonathan Spence does a very noble job summarizing one of the most powerful, mysterious, fascinating, and frightening persons of the twentieth century.  Though if one is looking for a book that goes into detail about any aspect of Mao's life or policies, it is best to look elsewhere.  This book is a straightforward and unabashed introduction and quick overview of Mao's life and work and ideas.  Perfect for people curious about Mao and twentieth century China who want to read more than an abstract, but do not necessarily need or want to tackle a big and detailed work.  Just the facts and little commentary.  Spence does a good job balancing any bias against or for Mao and his policies and deals mostly with the reasons for them and overall consequences",1
"437","Wow - my ears are opened!"," I just got a book out of the library.  The author is a nut about recording songs and analyzing the sonograms (frequency intensity over time), and in his mind, when he hears a song, he identifies it by how it ""looks"" in his mental sonogram.This whole idea is amazing, and I think I'll never listen to birds the same way again - just after reading the first few pages!The writing style pulls you into the author's world as he tracks birds and ponders the meaning of their song.  If you love birding, you will wish you had been there on every walk, and you'll want to wake up two hours before dawn the next day to discover the amazingly different pre-dawn songs of common birds.The book comes with as CD with 98 tracks of songs, and some of the tracks are slowed down, which really changes your perception and shows you the depth and richness of some of those ""blurt"" sounds birds make.  The Woodthrush  at 1/10 speed reminds me of a howling wolf.  I know I'll never listed to this song the same way again",1
