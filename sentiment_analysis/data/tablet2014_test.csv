The screen blacks out, chargers don't work, and if you do get it charged, it lasts for maybe 45 minutes.  If it was jus one of them, maybe just a defective item, but all three are bad.","2014-01-16",0

"85521","Expectations set too high","Jack Unangst","R2Z7X9MJVB08YI","This was bought for me, Jack's wife, for a recent cruise and to continue its use for banking, reading, Sudoku and games when we travel.  I am surprised that I have to buy most reading material, it is not easy to navigate around, and I bought a cover that Best Buy promised would turn the Kindle Fire off when the cover was closed.  That did not occur on the cruise and I am being charged $216.45 for it constantly running even though it was closed and stowed in my luggage.  I bought minutes onboard so I could check my emails and the day I opened it we had received a contract on our house so I was glad I had overpaid onboard ship for the service but never expected to be charged beyond the minutes I had bought.  There seems to be signs that this Kindle Fire was previously owned.  I have found another's email address in it.  Not sure I am happy with it and wonder what your return policy is?  Thank you, Thelma Unangst","2014-01-29",0
"71838","my brand new Kindle Fire HDX 7, didn't work. My replacement SECOND KINDLE , worked better, but I had problems.","Amazon Customer","RWAQBKRLU5FLH","I am bummed by this new Kindle. It was defective. It wouldn't stay connected to the internet. I talked with the kindle support and they helped we check it out but ultimately they told me to send it back and they sent me a new one 2 days later. Customer service gets a 10 in my book. The battery runs down to fast.I received my replacement Kindle Fire.  I really like the display and functionality but I don't understand why I should have to turn it off several times a day and clear applications of previous content in order to keep it connected to the WiFi.I couldn't tolerate the inconvenience of restarting the device over and over. Customer service is excellent. I chose to send this back within my return period so I could get a refund of my purchase price.  I really like Amazon and I appreciate shopping through them. I do not like to give negative comments. I am  generally a satisfied customer.Personally I feel this Kindle needs to be upgraded to work without these difficulties.I purchased a Samsung Note 8 and it is performing perfectly. I got the Kindle app and am enjoying my books and a whole lot more. The difference is remarkable.","2014-01-04",0
"110019","Waste of my money","Tracey M. Torreyson","R1O2OIT6WD450M","Both my sons have one of these tablets and I absolutely don't like them! The battery on these things can be 90% or more and the thing turns off on them while they are playing a game or reading (and it does it QUITE often) and won't turn back on unless you plug the thing in. And when it is working, it runs slow. For $150.00 a pop, I think these tablets could have been better quality. For their birthdays this year I will be replacing them with the Kindle Fire. Good thing I hadn't bought one for my daughter yet!","2014-01-22",0

"97853","Only good for kids.  Can't run apps from the Google Store.","R. Singer","R1LPEI1JA1F4NS","Amazed to learn that Amazon prevents you from loading apps from the Google Store.  To my knowledge, Amazon's are the only Android devices that do that.  Instead, you can only load apps from Amazon.  There are dramatically less apps in Amazon's store than Googles.  All of the business and art apps that I use on my phone are not in the Amazon store.Other than that, this makes a great toy for a kid.  Toy because even the educational app selection is limited.I don't understand why more people aren't complaining about this.  I'm guessing they don't realize what they're missing.","2014-01-14",0

"118799","Screen pops off, can't get any free apps!","leah7195","R6WA20IIQCXLZ","I bought this for my 18 yr old daughter for Christmas. Her and her boyfriend had it out of it's box for about 2 hours when the screen popped out of place...reallly! It's not like they are 10 and mishandling it! They also could not get but a few apps that they really wanted. The OS doesn't support very many of the popular apps.I had read the reviews on this product and some said the screen popped off but I ignored them thinking that an 18 yr old could take care of it. So I bought it anyway, thinking I would get a decent tablet for a bargain price. You really can't skimp if you want good quality. It even looks cheap.I returned it and ended up buying her another popular brand on sale for $60 more than what I paid for the Dragon, but it was worth it because she loves it!","2014-01-18",0
"22840","Not worth the money","jpdingdong ""Jon P.""","R37UXGSDD771B7","I've had my prime for several years. Had I know what a nightmare their customer services is, I would never have bought the unit. The camera died and it took two months to get this thing back only after contacting their HQ in Taiwan. The customer support line people are reading scripts like little robots and are not allowed to contact the people who actually fix the units directly. They also make you pay for shipping.Also, the cheap plastic on the USB cable literally fell off and they refused to replace it. Had this been Apple customer services, they would have replaced it and given me a $20 for iTunes.Wireless performance is very poor, GPS ended up in Asus loosing a class action lawsuit and scrolling is very jerky. Overall, a catastrophic and expensive customer experience.","2014-01-07",0

Comes with its own Kurio app store which is worthless and also has a few others you can install, amazon app being the only one worth using. One of the app stores had a porn app on it. This is suppose to be a family friendly tablet. The Kurio runs on a Android platform but is not approved by Google to run Google Play app store.

Then shortly after that it would fully charge at 66%, then 49%. So now, after owning it for barely a month it won't hold a charge at all. I know it's plugged in correctly as the charge symbol appears, but now my kindle won't even power on. So frustrating!

"55745","Barely worked and then died","Maurice J. Halmos ""Maurice""","RVMNSHVSJATZJ","I received this product, and the touch screen was very erratic.  Had it replaced, and still was a bit erratic, I believe that the screen protector made it really bad, and without it it worked somewhat OK.  The battery life was never too good, maybe 1-2 hours.Soon, the device would only work if plugged in, and later even that didn't work.  I only used the tablet occasionally maybe once or twice a month. The warranty has run out, so I learned how bad a cheap tablet can really be.  I would not recommend this tablet for anyone who doesn't enjoy total frustration.","2014-01-03",0

"44691","Not what I expected","SQL, UNIX, Rams, Cavaliers ""Mmm... Beer.""","RY0OKKORA6NRX","I received this as a holiday gift. The cool factor of having (another) tablet did not last more than a day for a few reasons. I love Android OS.The most frustrating feature of the Kindle is the on board web browser Silk. It is clumsy and does not offer advanced privacy options. This is my paramount desire. Alternating between the Amazon accelerated/encrypted browsing off and on, several of the websites I visit most are slow. I am looking at a very popular sport team's fan site, which was claimed to have been optimized for most modern browsers. The text forums take over a minute to load and scrolling is disjointed and clunky. Every time I exit silk, I must remember to delete all temporary files, settings, and passwords as I do not trust storing them, or the cookies and silk contains no setting to automatically browse ""in private"" (even though even with Firefox that is a misnomer, and other precautions should be taken).The Amazon app store is equally clumsy. Try searching for a specific item. I was looking for Final Fantasy games, and results ended up with items that obviously were not what I was searching for. There aren't enough controls or oversight on the content available, and it is hard to determine if the software (app) you are considering is what you actually desire. As much as I hate Apple, I do also have an IPad and, as much as I loathe DRM, Apple's presentation is much more polished. Both could stand slight updates in allowing additional advanced search options in regards to their respective digital store fronts. If I can't tell if the results from my search are a word document, a picture, a video, or a game then there is a very big problem.This introduces a criticism where these two issues merge: The app store does not currently offer any other reputable web browser options. Silk is terrrrrible, and Mozilla products are tagged as not currently available. After some quick internet searching, I figured out how to get on the beta releases for one of the more popular browser options that gives the end user more control. I have yet to be able to devote the time necessary to make it fully compatible with my needs; flash is not readily available and my web browsing is limited as a result. I still have to use Silk if I want to watch YouTube.What I actually want in a tablet is something that gives me control over my product, without challenging me to change it without voiding the warranty. I want to be able to change the wallpaper. I do not want to see an advertisement every time I pick it up; in all likelihood, I am probably not going to buy the junk you are trying to sell to me. I can't stand the carousel. Every time I finish with something I remove it from the home screen. If someone truly enjoys that type of file management assistance, they should go with an MS product. The constant monitoring Amazon does on the device limits the performance of the hardware, and robs resources that would otherwise enhance performance. Pass on this. I think the only way I will get what I want is if I build it myself, or root something with the hardware I need.Edit: I forgot to mention charging, which took 10 hours to go from 3% to 100%. I also managed to get to 14% from 100%, while being connected to the charger which came with the device.","2014-01-28",0
"23554","Horrible Product","sarahhop2","R20DXZCK5B7RW5","We purchased a Le Pan tablet in December 2012. In July of 2013, the tablet would no longer charge so eventually wouldn't even turn on. At that time, I contacted Le Pan and they sent a brand new replacement tablet. Last week, the graphics on the replacement tablet became completely jumbled and discolored. I contacted Le Pan once again, went through all of their troubleshooting steps however nothing fixed it. I have been told today that only the original tablet was warrantied and because the warranty on the original tablet expired in December of 2013, they will not fix or replace our current tablet. These are terrible products.","2014-01-23",0

"119600","IPAD AIR unusable, tech support is worthless.","Dr. Sarah M. Young","R11CXF8RPTZQJW","I purchased the IPAD air last week. When I tried to activate my accounts it would not allow it because apparently since I changed carriers I could not use my old Apple ID because it is tied to the old carrier. I can't establish a new Apple ID because I have an old one and if they delete the old one I lose all the apps I've paid for. I contacted Apple Technical where I was required to purchase tech support before they would do anything.  After doing this I went through multiple calls with multiple levels of support over three days so far with more to come. Seems that if the tech makes a mistake it stops the process and you have to wait 24 hours for them to be able to continue. They promise to call back and so far they have not so I called them to start the frustrating cycle all over again. I can't get the apps I want until this if fixed. I also can't connect to Facebook. For a machine this expensive plus having to pay for tech support for something that is Apple's fault I now believe Apple products aren't worth the gas to go buy one. I've been using Apples since the Apple Plus and I feel abused as a customer for the IPAD AIR. On top of all this they just had the gall to send me an email thanking me for contacting Apple Support. They have charged me for something a user should be able to do online with a new machine that is supposed to be the latest and greatest and it is just a paper weight right now. Can't return it because there is nothing wrong with it. Seems to me Apple is unethical and does not care about customers after a purchase. Dr. Sarah young","2014-01-26",0

No matter how many times you shut off the debugging.You-Tube on Chrome?! Impossible!Drop Box?! Impossible!Pou?! Yeah right! It freezes as soon as you shut the lights off!Fastnote?! The whole app just blows up!CRASHES TO THE MAX!Crashes almost EVERY app!The menu at the bottom always seems DEAD because it ALWAYS CRASHES!A good tablet for six month old baby, yeah. But me? No way.I couldn't believe how upset this thing actually made me. I tried so hard to make it work, and it just didn't. I had it since August, I put up with it for that long. It's obvious, that just because it's cheap, doesn't mean it's good. (But I refuse to buy an iPad, worth the same amount as a BRAND NEW desktop PC!)I pressed debug and it no longer connects to the computer, refuses to sync sometimes, if syncing was ever good. So, I had to factory reset the whole thing. Oh, yeah. And when you press Factory Reset, it won't reset! You have to download some other software just to get it to reset itself! So, yeah, I reset it. It took all my apps with it. NO problem, because I backed up the entire thing. I click restore on the backup, asks for password. NO PROBLEM. I set one earlier. And then suddenly, THAT AIN'T THE RIGHT PASSWORD! AND, just to kick more sand in my eyes, there is NO password recovery! So, I had to re-install all the apps all over again! I tried so hard NOT to get upset! AND I DIDN'T! I wanted to LIKE this thing!Oh, yeah! There's more!So, life's good, for now, as I sit here trying to cope with the lost of all my apps. I'm so scared to download anything, all I do is download three apps. MY other siblings have them, so I know they aren't bad apps! Suddenly, the whole tablet shuts down when I try to disable the sound on the Google keyboard. I turn the STUPID thing back on it starts to tell me it's encrypting! I didn't set it to encrypt! I wasn't even IN the security settings (I was in the LANGUAGE AND INPUT settings!) So, of course, I shut it back off. I turn it back on it shoots me something like, ""Encryption was a failure, your tablet is no longer accessible. You HAVE to factory reset."" Of course, I didn't want to, but I honestly CAN NOT do anything else unless I reset it! OF COURSE I'm mad as you know what! Of course I WANT to return it! BUT (OF COURSE) I CAN NOT return it because it's WAY past 30 days over due!IF this thing was trying to give me a heart attack, it ALMOST worked! ALMOST! But I can tell you this, it AIN'T Android! MY whole family has Android tablets! And not ONCE have I heard them complain about theirs! I just don't have the slightest CLUE why they would make such a product like this, KNOWING all their other ones are okay! Maybe it's just me! But I doubt it since I've grown up with electronics, and half of my family have COLLEGE EXPERIENCE in electronics AND software INCLUDING me!The sad part? I bought this tablet to use for college to take NOTES! I should have known when it couldn't even handle note taking it was a dud!So, If I could give it zero stars, or even throw it back to their facility, then I would!DO NOT BUY THIS!

"87210","Blue/Purple Haze- Very disappointing","Traditionalist","R3MYSGFEO4PDI6","Amazon has disclosed the fact that the blue LED attribute of the HDX 7"" creates a blue/purple haze around the edges of white reading pages and white web pages. While this blue LED attribute may provide true colors for movies, games, photos, etc., it is most distracting and disturbing to readers. I have an older 32GB Fire HD, and the reading light has none of this blue/purple tinge. Before ordering this unit, I contacted customer service and was told that the problem existed only on a small number of units, and that I could replace the unit if the problem occurred. When I received the unit, the problem was very apparent, and I have decided to simply return the unit and order the newer Kindle Fire HD 7"", which uses white light LED. I would have preferred to replace it with my older generation Kindle Fire HD 7"", a more enhanced unit, but Amazon no longer sells that model. Since first writing this review I have received the newer Kindle Fire HD 16gb, and there is no blue haze on the unit. I do not miss the camera, microphone, and auto adjust brightness features. So, for $184 for the HD vs. $254 (with $30 deal)on the HDX, I believe I have come out ahead and ultimately purchased the model that is right for me.","2014-01-23",0

"114465","Specs On Paper Does Not Match Performance.","G. Davis","R1UGCDYLBV57D3","I received my Latte iMuz Q9 Android 4.2 9.7"" XHD IPS screen quad core tablet on Jan 3, 2014. Let me say that Amazon shipping service is great! The table looked great; it came in a nice professional package. However, the specs that look good on paper doesn't perform well in reality. Let me start with the Tablet itself. It almost looked like an Ipad with exception of the metal back plate (which I thought looked cool). It was your typical built tablet like any other brand when it came to the materials. Next the screen, I will have to say the screen was nice indeed though the brightness control was very poor. The camera was terrible. I know that is not the main reason why we get a tablet but it should be working properly and take great pics. I found the pics and the videos to be grainy and was very poor quality. I did not like the fact it came with a charger instead of charging it through the USB port. It isn't a deal breaker, but it is just more stuff to carry with you if you plan on traveling. The videos from Netflix and HBOGo ran choppy. It should have been smoothed considering the hardware inside. It did come installed with Google Play so that was a plus. When flicking between screens, it seemed like you have to flick quick to get the screen moving. I was real excited when it came in but was disappointed. Even worse, after 30 minutes of play time with it, I could never get it to come back on. I have already sent it back to Amazon for a refund. If you are looking to root or whatever, it is best to move on to something that is more familiar to electronic consumers. This tablet had potential but just couldn't reach the mark.","2014-01-06",0

"107945","Stop working after 2 months","JTW ""jtw""","RGJ3F6EV2O7CL","I know there is always a chance, every now and then, of getting the ""dud"" when purchasing electronics.  Unfortunately, this particular tablet was a dud.  After 2 months of very minimal use, it just stopped working; wouldn't even come on.  When it was working, still wasn't impressed.  It had some software glitches and the ""feel"" of the tablet itself was very cheap.  The power/wake-up/sleep button is in a very odd place:  it's on the back-right of the tablet which made its use somewhat difficult and was a nuisance.  I suggest spending a few $$$ more and getting a more reputable brand.","2014-01-05",0

"73132","Free Time App is MUCH less useful than we thought...","Amazon Customer ""Jessica Donahoe""","R2UYIRTWRGNB8P","There are plenty of reviews for the kindle itself. This review is specifically for parents hoping to use the free time app, which is the specific reason why we bought this kindle. (we already have two others)First, the app is not intuitive at all. I see no reason to make it so difficult to navigate. I can never figure out where I am or where I need to go and find myself having to log in all over again while trying to navigate it.Second, there is no way to control content under the amazon free time subscription. We chose NOT to use this app, because it means giving content control over to Amazon, and we don't necessarily agree with them on what is good content for our child. They include things we would not and leave out things our child would like that we find acceptable for him.Third, even if you have a prime account, you cannot stream free video content within the free time app unless you pay for the subscription to use the content amazon has chosen. Within the free time app, you must purchase and download any vidoes your kid wants to watch.Fourth (this is minor compared to the other three, but still an issue for us), it would be nice if there was an option for reading time vs other time. Right now we have to set individual app and video times. We'd like him to be able to choose either for the full amount of time. Not that he often will, but we'd love for him to be able to choose educational apps for his full allotment of time. Also, a lot of apps have videos, and netflix ends up being an app, so the line between apps & videos is blurred anyway.If you are a parent who thinks this will make managing time with electronics easier, think again.","2014-01-18",0

"114255","I've had this for two months now and it give me such a headache","Barbara Mcauliffe","R2VGJNXRAO253H","I’ve had this device for over two months now.  Up until last week I loved it for surfing the net. Well, that’s changed now.  There was an update last week that somehow made the back button disappear, the place where you type in a search term went away and so did favorites.  It did allow you to go to your frequently used sites. Only because I like to check out the Bing pictures every day did I have a search engine. It was fixed within hours but…I don’t do gaming like some people.  I’m happy with MS solitaire and mahjong and these are all right on the SP2, but sometimes you go to the game and it starts up and reverts to the main menu.  I read that this is known to MS and a fix is in the works, but…I find the battery life to be good, about 6 hours using the video recorder and One Note on the split screen.  It is heavy, but the day a bunch of turkeys came into my yard (birds not neighbors) it was light enough to grab and run around after them taking pics.  Honestly, I don’t really imagine myself holding this up in the air for any amount of time.The screen kind of fades and brightens a lot.  Again this is supposed to be on MS fix list, but it persists.But the thing that gives me a constant headache is using this dog for anything other than entertainment. I bought this to use in a class.  The purpose of buying this device and Office 365 was the promise that all would work seamlessly.  You can get video to copy to One Note (not the free One Note which does not accept video according to MS, I’m talking about the One Note in office 365) but you have to change the file type.  This isn’t that big a deal, but really??? Its MS’s big time machine and One Note is a huge thing for MS, why doesn’t the video record in the right file type?  Of course One Note (in Office 365) actually has a video record button itself.  But that only records the camera facing me.  Honestly, I’d rather record the professor.Nothing will save to One Note.  Rather, noting will save to the One Note in Office 365. You can save links to the free One Note and only links, not the content.  To get anything to save in One Note you have to save it to the computer then print to One Note. Is this what they call seamless? I need web pages and emails stored in class notes, (and not links because this is a horticulture class, we are not always in range of wireless) this is so clunky I want to scream. The One Note/Surface combo is something MS is supposed to be so proud of.  It is a failure.  Period.E-mail!!! When the machine was new and I turned it on it said something like…we know you don’t want any social updates so we aren’t sending them to you.  If you decide you want them do something or another.  In my excitement to see what was on the machine, I just went ahead.  It had to be obvious how to get my emails back, right? Hah.  It took days to get what MS was calling sort of but not quite  junk and what I call my calendar for the following week,  back in my mailbox.Even worse is some days I get a “We can’t contact Hotmail right now” message when I try to check email.  My phone can get my email, why can’t my Surface?  It’s not the wireless, I’m not in the field.  If I can’t be sure of getting my email what use is this thing?Another problem is the crappy help system MS has devised for this thing.  Each screen has its own help.  If you think the help should be on screen one but MS has decided it makes sense for help to be on screen 8 you are screwed. Why don’t they have one central help? And while we’re at it, why don’t they have an index so if you thing something is called “A” you can still find it even though MS calls it “R” The way it works now is inane. There is a main page help, but really it’s just a brag page, like Wow we can do this.  Well, I already got the darn thing; you don’t have to sell me on it. Tell me in detail how to use it.  I haven’t been so frustrated by a computer since the DOS days.The type cover is fine but the mouse pad thing on it simply doesn’t work.  You know all those ads with people snapping down the key board and starting to work.  Hah!!! How do you think they would look if you were told the truth.  Snap down the keyboard, attach the mouse then start to work This is a huge failThe pen works fine, the holder is a joke.  The slightest touch will disconnect it. Another failI so looked forward to getting this.  I love my Windows Lumina 925 and thought this would be even better. But, I can’t recommend this to anyone.  Maybe in a few years this will work, but it doesn’t now.  I’ve read on this site among others that it’s hard to make a hybrid.  Well, I’ll go along with weight part of that, but the rest, no.  They have all the programs on this but it’s as though no one thought to actually try them out on the device.  There are probably other students who need a computer for classes and can use their phones for real light weight things, this would be perfect if it worked.  It doesn’t work.","2014-01-10",0

"112544","Systemic Bluetooth Issues","Mike S. ""VTSoundMan""","RRGM58NC6HP9R","If you have any desire to use this tablet with Bluetooth devices, do not purchase it.  Save your money and time.  I purchased this tablet with the hopes of using it as a desktop replacement - and using with a keyboard and/or mouse. Any/all Bluetooth devices drop on this tablet.  I have upgraded it to version 4.3 .  Doing a search on the internet reveals this is a systemic issue for the 2014 model. When calling Samsung tech support, they claim not to know it is an issue - however, they will tell you it is a software issue and to 'wait for the update.'  They cannot provide any time for the update...and aren't the ones publishing it.  Too bad - this thing is a nice product otherwise.  I will comment that my Bluetooth devices work well with my Galaxy S4 and other Android Devices.**UPDATE **After speaking with Samsung customer service, they continue to deny there is a problem with the 2014 units.  However, per the customer service rep, Samsung pulled their planned Bluetooth keyboard (he saw it in Beta) - and commented it was quite unusual for Samsung not to have released a keyboard by now.  I published a negative review on the Samsung website about this issue - only to have it pulled from the site.  Shame Shame Samsung for releasing a product with a defect like NO reliable Bluetooth for key'd & mouse. I also am not sure I can attribute this is an Android issue - I have other 4.3 devices *namely a 7"" Nexus tablet* running 4.3.  And that unit works GREAT with various Bluetooth keyboards + mice. Granted, this is a small sample, but something is amiss here.  I also performed a factory reset - no dice.","2014-01-03",0
"117292","IPAD AIR unusable, tech support is worthless.","Dr. Sarah M. Young","R11CXF8RPTZQJW","I purchased the IPAD air last week. When I tried to activate my accounts it would not allow it because apparently since I changed carriers I could not use my old Apple ID because it is tied to the old carrier. I can't establish a new Apple ID because I have an old one and if they delete the old one I lose all the apps I've paid for. I contacted Apple Technical where I was required to purchase tech support before they would do anything.  After doing this I went through multiple calls with multiple levels of support over three days so far with more to come. Seems that if the tech makes a mistake it stops the process and you have to wait 24 hours for them to be able to continue. They promise to call back and so far they have not so I called them to start the frustrating cycle all over again. I can't get the apps I want until this if fixed. I also can't connect to Facebook. For a machine this expensive plus having to pay for tech support for something that is Apple's fault I now believe Apple products aren't worth the gas to go buy one. I've been using Apples since the Apple Plus and I feel abused as a customer for the IPAD AIR. On top of all this they just had the gall to send me an email thanking me for contacting Apple Support. They have charged me for something a user should be able to do online with a new machine that is supposed to be the latest and greatest and it is just a paper weight right now. Can't return it because there is nothing wrong with it. Seems to me Apple is unethical and does not care about customers after a purchase. Dr. Sarah young","2014-01-26",0

The replacement kindle fire hd stopped working after about 30 days. So far in the last 3 months we have had to replace all of our kindle, for various reasons (freezing, battery errors, just stopped working), I was willing to pay the 30 dollar difference to upgrade to the hdx just hoping that I would not have to go through this whole process again. For the 4th time. The online chat supervisor was total unwilling to help. This in addition to the fact that I was one of the customers that did not get my Christmas order on time. This whole ordeal has me second guessing my future ordering, especially since Best Buy will now match Amazon pricing.","2014-01-01",0

These tablets come from somewhere in Asia where quality-control isn't important, I'm guessing the seller gets these tablets at a very low cost in Asia and sells them here in the United States for $70 dollars a pop which is a good scam.","2014-01-14",0

I thought I had done something wrong at first maybe I didn't plug it in right or something. It got worse over time so I reset it, I bought a new cord everything I could think of, nothing worked and it got to the point i could not get it to charge at all. I researched it online to find out this is a VERY common problem, a design flaw. Of course by this time my warranty expired, guess i wasted too much time trying to find a quick fix. Well customer service will replace with a re-manufactured one for the same price I could purchase a NEW one on sale. I would then be paying a total of $280.00 for a 1st Generation Kindle Fire. I think since it is a design defect (the charging port is only held in place by solder on the board, nothing else) it should be taken care of just like a recall on a car defect.

"110763","The wifi works when it wants to.. who needs that garbage?","miss-honesty ""Tiffany""","R23K9TCQD2695B","I ordered this mid-December in time for Christmas for my mother. She lugs around the laptop and was having trouble carrying it. Her computing needs could be covered by this tablet so I purchased it. For under two hundred dollars, the reviews looked favorable enough I decided on this relatively unknown brand. Her eyes aren't that good so I needed to get her the ten inch tablet versus a seven inch one. It's unfortunate because for that same money a good brand could have been procured in 7''.At first, I was pleased with myself. She loved it. The HD display is nice, the weight is on point and it did everything she needed it to do. The camera has a very low resolution and that was initially all I disliked about it. Now it is hardly February and she's having wireless issues. Mainly, the internet will work on one day and not on another. How is she supposed to cope with that? I've tried working it upstairs, and downstairs when it's within several feet of the router. This router can operate two laptops and a phone without problems. I tried using this tablet with ONLY the Matricom requesting internet. No dice. I just looked into my orders to return it thinking I'd try out another tablet to see if this was merely some hardware fault in her particular one. My window expired TWO days ago. I now plan on buying a more reliable brand like Asus or Samsung and I'll be the proud owner of this secondhand paperweight. Thanks, Matricom. I'll remember that I shouldn't roll the dice on electronics.My advice? Stick to a brand you've already tried and found to be true. The knock-offs can really burn you. This is by far my worst purchase in years of Amazon. I'd better go get some ICE for this BURN.","2014-02-02",0

After recharging it, I used the Mayday button and they told me that it may have overheated and that I should do a hard reboot (hold the off button for twenty seconds).  It happened again but figured that it overheated again because the back of the Kindle WAS hot.  The third time, Mayday checked to see if I had the most recent update (I did) so I did the hard reboot and it worked fine.  I decided to do a hard reboot once a week and make sure that it doesn't overheat.  I did the reboot this morning, listened to music from my cloud and then put it down to do other stuff.

"79369","It pains me to have to give this one star....","Amazon Customer","R1WTVB0EOQEBKY","This is the most difficult one star review I've had to give. Usually a one star product is clearly junk, but that is not the case here.If I were to rate the hardware only (I bought the HDX 8.9 w/o special offers), I would say it's a five star product. But we can't just rate this on hardware alone, we have to look at both the software and Amazon's walled garden policies.I read all the reviews from the gadget sites about how this was somewhat crippled by lack of access to google play, but that you could sideload apps, and that if you wanted to consume Amazon content that it was a good choice. As all I wanted it for was to read ebooks, I thought it would be perfect. It has probably the best screen I've seen on a tablet (compared to my new Galaxy Note 2014 and my wife's Ipad Retina, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 is the better screen). The problem was I have a lot of technical ebooks (I'm a software developer) from Oreilly press, and I prefer PDF format for these. I also have a few ePub books. I did some research and found moon+ reader pro in the Amazon store. I figured I was good to go, I could buy Moon Reader + pro and have a device that could read all my kindle books, watch amazon prime, and read my ePubs and PDFs. Then the tablet came and I logged in to the store, and Moon Reader + Pro was not listed. I followed a link from the web and lo-and-behold it says ""Not compatible with your device""..which was interesting because the free version worked just fine. I wanted the pro because It supports PDFs and the ads are annoying. I then looked for other readers in the Amazon store that would support ePub or PDF and work on my device and guess what...there weren't any. Interestingly enough, there are other readers in the Amazon store such as Aldiko..they just say they aren't compatible with the HDX 8.9.. if you sideload them from the web they work fine though so it's not a compatibility issue. It's Amazon putting artificial limits on what content you can easily view on a kindle device. I don't mind the lack of Google Play because I can understand Amazon not wanting to pay to license from Google or follow Google's policies. But when they have apps that work for what I want in their App store but they intentionally limit access to them to Kindle Devices because they allow ePub and PDF content I have a problem with that.In closing, I would say that if you want to consume Amazon content, an Apple Ipad is currently the best choice. You have full access to a huge selection of apps, and you get the ability to view Amazon Instant Video and you get Text To Speech in the kindle reader. I absolutely despise Apple products so it pains me to recommend them, but for Amazon content the Ipad is the best choice. Android is purposefully crippled by Amazon. They do not have an Instant Video app for Android (other than for the Kindle Fire) and they don't support Text To Speech for Android (again other than the Kindle Fire). As for me I returned the Kindle and bought a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition. I don't get prime videos, but I do get Netflix if I want and I've started looking elsewhere for books and movies.I originally started buying from Amazon because I liked the choice, I liked the customer service, and they made things easy. With this tablet, they have taken away the choice of content and nothing was easy. Customer service is the only thing left. I'll still shop at Amazon for almost everything else I buy, but my great opinion of them was tarnished by the whole experience and I probably won't buy another Kindle device. At least they made it very easy to return the Kindle Fire.","2014-02-25",0

At first it would fix itself if I restarted it, but not anymore. I called asus support and told them and they told me to switch to the old jellybean. I did what they said and it worked, but then only two weeks later the screen stopped responding again. I called asus again and they told me to restart the product to factory defaults. I restarted it and once again it worked for 2 to 3 weeks until the screen stopped working again...When I called asus this time they said there is nothing they can do because it is out of warranty! It was out of warranty by only 10 days and they said it didn't matter that I had called with the same problem with the tablet multiple times when it was under warranty. The only thing the representative said was that he could do was have it fixed for $200+.I asked to speak to a manager and the representative argued with me saying that it was unnecessary to speak to the manager. When he finally transferred me I was on hold for 30 minutes until I hung up.I called again the next day and immediately asked to speak to a manager and was again on hold for 30 minutes. I still have yet to speak to a manager... This is the worst service I have seen.

Kolinjavadi ""skolin""","R10V9BS5V2VL94","Excellent tablet, layout and very good price, but how come Samsung have gotten away with a tablet whose wifi connection becomes sub-par when you let it rest or go into power saving mode for a while, when it comes back, your home wifi is toothless, though the other devices are doing just fine. This is a major problem with this device and the cause of the two stars missing. Im surprised there has been no fix for this yet.---UPDATE-----This is the most disappointing thing of all, its now a BRICK that may require surgery before it can walk again. Evidently I'm not the only victim of what sums upto to very poor engineering and worse still evidence of continued indifference, many Samsung products including this one get into a vegetative state if you happen to let the battery completely run down before you put it back on charge. I had this misfortune last week when I did not have quick access to the charger and now the damn thing won't wake back up no matter how much I charge, its playing dead as a DODO and it happened one day after my return window ended.

After recharging it, I used the Mayday button and they told me that it may have overheated and that I should do a hard reboot (hold the off button for twenty seconds).  It happened again but figured that it overheated again because the back of the Kindle WAS hot.  The third time, Mayday checked to see if I had the most recent update (I did) so I did the hard reboot and it worked fine.  I decided to do a hard reboot once a week and make sure that it doesn't overheat.  I did the reboot this morning, listened to music from my cloud and then put it down to do other stuff.  Several hours later, I picked it up to play a word search game and it FROZE AGAIN!!!  It had only been on for two minutes and the back was completely cool.  I'm done.","2014-02-01",0

I really did.","Daniel S.","R2HFI23H3H0PMO","I bought a 64 GB KFire HDX direct from Amazon just before Christmas when they were doing the installment plan, and really liked it. However, the display suffered more from the ""blue"" on the sides more than others I'd seen. Even the display model at my local Best Buy didn't have the huge variance this one did. So, I sent it back and got a replacement from Amazon.And then that replacement's display started flickering randomly. Complete wipe and reinstall didn't help, another hardware issue.So, I contacted Amazon for a THIRD device. Which they sent quickly....and that one had more screen issues.I don't know if I just had bad luck, but that's the point when I gave up. Three devices in a row tells me that either I had extraordinarily bad luck, or Amazon's QA on these devices just isn't up to snuff. I used the refund for mine to get a nice new Paperwhite which (so far) is flawless.If you want a tablet and really don't want to play roulette on whether you get a good one? I'd advise getting an iPad or a Nexus 7 instead. This one just irked me one too many times with the return-replace-defective cycle. Sorry, Amazon.

As for the charger its not the right playbook charger it came with a small blackberry charger rated 800mah (original playbook charger rated 1800mah and with yellow usb tip)as for the unit itself it had me wonder if this is a refurbished unit and looks like new but it was clean with no scratches but surely was stored somewhere for a reallg long time since battery was completely drained and wasnt able to get anything out of it. After charging for 4 hours the battery got up from zero % to 2% and then it charged normally to 100 % in 1 hour 30 minutes just as it should (this is what happens when a unit is left for long period with battery completely drained) overall since this is my second playbook I was really disapointed with it but in fairness to the unit itself once I powered it up after solving the battery issue and updated to the latest version OS it ran as it should and had no signs of problems.","2014-02-14",0

"58786","ipad vs MS Surface","Aman","R3SMMYSRY22ZAE","I have 2 iPads previously and so when time came to buy another, iPad was the top contender, but given the rising popularity of Microsoft Surface and Samsung Galaxy tab, I decided to try those out. MS Surface won hands down in my experience.First off, you can actually run more than one website on the Surface. If playing a Youtube video on the Surface and at the same time briefly browsing a different website, the Youtube video continues to play. Not so on the iPad. The video stops the momemt you browse to another website even in a different tab.Secondly, as far as Youtube is concerns the Surface version runs all videos like a full blown laptop. The iPad version runs only a subset of the videos and tells you to play the others on a computer.Thirdly, the Surface has a built in stand. No need to buy a cover stand separately.Fourth, even when not using the stand, the Surface is much easier to hold in the hand - slips much less than the iPad.I like the Surface user interface for switching from one browser tab to another better than the iPad. Not sure if that's a definite win for everyone since some folks may prefer the IPad.Not to mention the Surface is about half the price. True, iOS has more apps, but for all the apps I use (Amazon Instant Video, Netflix, Youtube, Skype, WhatsApp, email, browser, Yelp, and some travel related apps), both have all the apps needed. In fact the Surface has more Office apps for those who care about Powerpoint and Word.","2014-02-23",0

I tried to start 2 live chat sessions and no one ever joined and then I finally reached someone on live chat and was told to perform two different methods for a factory reset - neither of them worked.  I would never recommend this product to anyone, not only because the Kurio itself is a poorly made product but because it is difficult to reach anyone at their company and they do not respond to tech support emails.

Of course it does not have an Ethernet connection so I can't even wire the paperweight to the internet.No apparent solution from Apple in the works as they appear to not recognize the problem is an iPad problem.I believe Apple IOS updates have degraded the capability.

"80878","Buyer BEWARE! Junk!","Alisa Dickson","R2TQN6GXVI9ZAQ","First, to clarify, I did not purchase this item from Amazon. But my review is for this model of Zeepad. I am so disappointed and frustrated with this purchase that I wanted to submit a review to save others the time, hassle and money. The first problem occurred when I attempted to read the user manual before doing anything with the tablet. It was horrific! The manual was written with english words but the grammatical errors, spelling errors and everything else about it was so poor that I couldn't make sense of it. It was like reading a different language with english words. Once I let it charge for the day I gave it a try, only to be completely disappointed! I realize I didn't purchase an iPad so I was willing to give it a chance. I tried to play a netflix from it only to find that I could hardly make out the image on the  screen. I also had to hold the tablet at one exact angle in order to even see anything. The sound was so poor I couldn't tell anything was even coming out of the speaker until I turned it over and held it right up to my ear. (That was after I had turned up all of the sound). The final complaint and what lead me to my decision to return it, (as if the above is not enough) is that there is such a delay when pressing an icon that I felt like I had to keep pushing it to make sure it was recognizing my touch. Actually, I can't say there is anything good about this tablet. Buyer beware, Do NOT but this! I don't even want to give it one star. It doesn't deserve it!This is by far the worst item I have ever purchased off the internet.","2014-02-01",0

Anyone who wants to buy it should first go to Microsoft community for surface pro and see how many problems might occur. This can be as simple as connecting to store, attaching type cover to work. The recommendation is to refresh or reset your machine. Then you have to to reinstall all software. You should be careful about updates as well. The email system does not show attachment files in search results. The first few days the system was ok. But suddenly the store can not be accessed but the internet connection is ok. I have to reset the whole system. The store works ok but the type cover does not work. You can't type anything. I have to refresh. again. The type cover worked but the store can not be accessed and the updates can not be loaded. I checked the Microsoft community and there is full of reports of all kinds of weird problems. There are updates almost everyday and some updates cause problem. I really don't recommend it to average user.","2014-02-14",0

We mainly got it for my son, my daughter has a Samsung 10.1 tablet, which is much easier to navigate.  But of course thru time I guess you could get used to it.  But my number one beef with it, is that if you, for example set a yahoo account, whenever you hit email icon, you're automatically logged in!  Really?  No password?  Which by the way, you cannot log out!! My Amazon account is the same!  My son finds something he wants and just purchase's it, luckily for me Amazon has to have ""confirmation"", otherwise I could be purchasing things I have no control over.It's not all bad I guess, if that's what you're looking for, but I just don't like the fact that there is no option of logging out.  I go to Amazon, log out, then click the Amazon icon and bam!  I'm back in!  WTF?!!  Not for me!  I hate it!!","2014-02-11",0

Still wouldn't turn on so I put it aside plugged into power.  Went back to it later and it was on.  It was working normally except it was always tricky to turn on.  Every time I wanted to use it I seemed  to have trouble getting it started. I contacted Tablet Express by email and they had developed a fix for the operating system.  I had to buy a micro SD card to download the file too, and then insert into the tablet and restart tablet.Well guess what. I couldn't get the tablet to start up.  So I got back in touch with the Tablet Express person and was given a different file. I could now start the tablet but it wouldn't update itself.  So I was told to ship the tablet back and they would fix it.  I wrapped it in bubble wrap and shipped it in. I received an email back saying the tablet screen was broken and that it wouldn't be warranty.  They asked me how it had gotten broke. Well during the time I was emailing back and forth I was sending them pictures of the screen that I was seeing. There was no breaks in the screen.  So I feel like I got nothing for my first foray into the tablet world.Thanks Tablet Express for nothing! You got my money and I got your junk.","2014-03-23",0

You'd think if they just made a product that, you know, didn't crap out after three days, they wouldn't need a PR-downvote squadron. PS, can I maybe get part-time work as a professional downvoter? Maybe it would help pay for school.)I'm writing this review on the laptop I got in exchange for the Microsoft Surface Pro 2 that I bought three days ago. It decided that it didn't feel like working anymore, so the touch interface and keyboard just stopped responding in any time shorter than 45 seconds. I couldn't even kill the process through the task manager because that froze too; nor could I even reboot it. Instead I got a laptop made by a company that believes in making products that work. FYI - Best Buy made the exchange process very easy.I needed a Windows machine for a grad class, and I had heard good things about this one. Frankly, I'm insulted that something this blatantly broken and unfinished was released with a $1000 price point.You'd think after 30 years of stealing other people's ideas and putting out one substandard product after another, Microsoft would understand that consumers will only take buying crap for so long. It's not good business sense to continue to market this trash and just assume consumers will buy it because they have no other choice. Market dominance is not an excuse to treat customers like this, nor is it something that lasts forever.(PS - for those who would downvote this review because they love MS products, spend your money however you wish and may God bless you.

I am certainly not racist by saying that - but these companies produce an extremely poor product, and the people they hire work for hardly any money.  Spend the extra money on a name brand.

"61808","Junk! horrible warranty service, major reliability issues","Construction pro","R2OHBRFRZCJXR","I have had this tablet for exactly one year and I regret ever buying it.  I have been very gentle with it and never damaged it.  However, I have had to send it to Texas 3, yes that's right, 3 times for warranty service.  Twice I had to pay shipping to get it there - about $30 worth.  The first time they had to replace a defective gyroscope- it suddenly stopped rotating the screen.  The second time it would continually try to reboot itself.  A complete reset would not fix the problem.  They sent it back saying nothing was found defective, but they obviously reloaded the software because it worked when it came back- for about 1 month.  Then it broke down the third time.  It just suddenly tried to reboot itself and wouldn't quit with the little swirling colored circles on the screen.  It would not even let me complete a factory reset and it stopped even turning itself on.  Each time it breaks down, you have to send the thing to Texas for service.  They keep it for over a week after they receive it, before they ship it back to you.  When they do ship it back, it is Fedex, and if you are not home all day to sign for it you have to go to Fedex to pick it up- a 1/2hour drive each way for me.  The total turn around time each repair is about 3 weeks from the time you ship it out until it arrives back at your local Fedex.  In one year I have lost all my data 3 times, have been without a tablet for 9 weeks total, and now I am awaiting it being shipped back to me the final time.  The thing is, my warranty expired during the time they were working on it, so next time it dies on me- that's it, I'm out my time, money, and data.  Really horrible way to treat an Asus customer!  I have an Asus desktop and 2 first gen Nexus 7's and a second gen Nexus 7.  I doubt I will buy another Asus product.  Beware!  By comparison, I had a Bosch circular saw that died after a year and a half of light use.  It was out of warranty, however Bosch fixed it free of charge and I got it back in exactly 1 week from the day I dropped it at UPS to go to Atlanta.  Asus needs to take a lesson from Bosch on how to do customer service.  Asus, you have lost my loyalty.","2014-03-04",0

"111669","Android 4.4 criticaly limits MicroSD use; Sluggish performance; Offers limited","Hodor","R3127BAILNYMGG","I purchased a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition (black, 16GB) at Best Buy a few weeks ago. I only used it for a few days before deciding to return it. There's a lot of stupid problems here, not all of which are Samsung's fault. But overall, it's a no-deal for me.1) The Simpsons game ""Tapped Out"" ran so slow as to be unusable. The constant stuttering of the screen updates and the slowed-down animation made it obvious that somehow this particular game challenged the quad-core processor in the Note. It's a serious defect, considering a two year old model like the ASUS TF300 could run the game 10 times faster, and THAT unit is sluggish. This might be a specific issue with this game, and could be a software fix from EA. But it's important to consider, as the game it's very popular and widely used.2) The offers are  good deals, but they are limited to the device itself. For example, the free year of GoGo Inflight Internet? That's not something you can add to your existing account or even create a new account for. Instead, everytime you want to use it you must connect to GoGo from this tablet, click on a ""Chat Now"" button and request from a CSR a one-time code for that flight. You'll need to repeat that process everytime you want to use it, and it can't be used on a laptop or other device. Similar limitations exist for many, but not all of the offers. The 3 free audio books? Only 1 per month. All of these offers are really just trial subscriptions with a few exceptions. I *strongly* recommend checking out the details and fine-print here before buying: [...]3) This Note uses Android 4.4 aka ""KitKat"". There is a major change in Android 4.4 that affects how MicroSD card access works. Apps will no longer be able to access the entire card and read or write anywhere they want. Instead, each app will have its own little closed-off area to use, nothing else. This means general-purpose file explorer apps will not be able to see anything on a MicroSD card. Photo viewers will be similarly limited. Backup programs will not be able to backup files from a MicroSD card (though they will be able to backup file TO the MicroSD card). Most significantly, you will NOT be able to move apps to the MiroSD to free-up space in the internal memory. This is all being done by Google, not Samsung, but it still impacts this model. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU READ THESE ARTICLES BEFORE PURCHASING THIS DEVICE:[...][...]","2014-03-24",0

"65720","Fantastic Device, Too many complaints,","Ben Small","R1T91Q0XFOVXVH","If you look online you'll see that there are hundreds of posts on forums about Nexus 7 not charging, etc. After a Year of use, my Nexus 7 died after having it's battery run down and shut off. Ever since then I haven't been able to charge it, even after trying every single solution I could find online, from disconnecting and reconnecting the battery's plugin to trying button combos. This week I decided to get a replacement battery, and after installing it the tablet would boot up like normal but still wouldn't charge. While installing the new battery I noticed that inside the tablet there is enough room for the battery to bump around and get loose, pulling on the plugin for it and making it destroy itself. I'm not the only person with this problem and I think you should rethink your choice because of how often this problem occurs.","2014-03-01",0
"39406","Nabi will make your kid cry","Eileen Long","R3D0V1WCTU47CO","I bought two of these for my grandchildren last year as I like the idea of something that would give them something they wanted with protection and educational aspects I wanted.  The product worked great at first though I was disappointed to see that most of the loaded apps were bloatware or just advertisements for me to spend more money on their education software.A big issue for some is unavoidable because Google won't allow devices access to Google Play if it modifies the operating system in any way.  Since the Nabi uses a modified version of Android software that limits access and that is a big part of the selling point for Nabi, Fuhu's only option was essentially Amazon's app store.  After finding out the education software that came with the device was worthless it would have been nice to be able to be able to bypass 'Mommy mode' if we could get to the Google Store.  As it was adding software was much more difficult than it needed to be and I expect only the most computer literate ever would figure it out.The device itself was nice and despite some of the complaints I've seen, you really had to go out of your way to damage it with the bumpers.  The screen is tougher than most others I've seen on the market and if a kids breaks a Nabi their drop would break a Ipad/Nexus/Kindle.  In fact I'd bet a Nabi would be the toughest of them all.All of the above is meaningless when considering the last issue.  After a month my biggest concern after getting software set up was trying to get them to do other things than play with their Nabi (as I've said earlier the educational software was a bait and switch).  Then we started having issues with one of the units screen as lines appeared and the only thing that would fix it was a reboot.  Anyone that has kids knows how bad it can be when one kid's device works and theirs doesn't so I spent countless hours with support trying to figure out the issue.  They released a software update but within another month the other device started doing the same thing.  The kids didn't mind rebooting but a few weeks later I released the devices weren't holding a charge as they'd charge them all night and they'd be dead 30 minutes later.  We had them use the cord when they used them but after a while even that wouldn't work.  Within 4 months both were very expensive bricks.The manufacturer has given some lip service that a new cord would fix the issue but it didn't work for us.  We tried to call customer support but gave up when 1) we never got a response and 2) saw thousands of others complaining about the same thing.  They ignored further contact for months well within the warranty period but after a while we (like most people I'd expect) gave up as it wasn't worth the frustration.Ultimately I think the combination of cheap parts, poor quality control, and modified software were too much for the great chip inside to offset (it uses the same processor you will find in many other devices like the Kindle and Nexus).  I do think someone at Fuhu knew these devices were faulty when they sold them and criminal charges should be filed but it will never happen.  I've written off the $400 we spent on these devices as money lost and my only regret is not getting a Kindle Fire or Nexus for the same price.And I will never buy anything from Fuhu ever again (though I doubt they will be around in another year with their rep).","2014-03-23",0

"65778","Junk! horrible warranty service, major reliability issues","Construction pro","R2OHBRFRZCJXR","I have had this tablet for exactly one year and I regret ever buying it.  I have been very gentle with it and never damaged it.  However, I have had to send it to Texas 3, yes that's right, 3 times for warranty service.  Twice I had to pay shipping to get it there - about $30 worth.  The first time they had to replace a defective gyroscope- it suddenly stopped rotating the screen.  The second time it would continually try to reboot itself.  A complete reset would not fix the problem.  They sent it back saying nothing was found defective, but they obviously reloaded the software because it worked when it came back- for about 1 month.  Then it broke down the third time.  It just suddenly tried to reboot itself and wouldn't quit with the little swirling colored circles on the screen.  It would not even let me complete a factory reset and it stopped even turning itself on.  Each time it breaks down, you have to send the thing to Texas for service.  They keep it for over a week after they receive it, before they ship it back to you.  When they do ship it back, it is Fedex, and if you are not home all day to sign for it you have to go to Fedex to pick it up- a 1/2hour drive each way for me.  The total turn around time each repair is about 3 weeks from the time you ship it out until it arrives back at your local Fedex.  In one year I have lost all my data 3 times, have been without a tablet for 9 weeks total, and now I am awaiting it being shipped back to me the final time.  The thing is, my warranty expired during the time they were working on it, so next time it dies on me- that's it, I'm out my time, money, and data.  Really horrible way to treat an Asus customer!  I have an Asus desktop and 2 first gen Nexus 7's and a second gen Nexus 7.  I doubt I will buy another Asus product.  Beware!  By comparison, I had a Bosch circular saw that died after a year and a half of light use.  It was out of warranty, however Bosch fixed it free of charge and I got it back in exactly 1 week from the day I dropped it at UPS to go to Atlanta.  Asus needs to take a lesson from Bosch on how to do customer service.  Asus, you have lost my loyalty.","2014-03-04",0

This happening made it clear to me that the product is the problem. My oldest child is 8 and knows how to handle and take care of tablets. She has been playing with my Kindle since I bought it 2 or 3 years ago. So now I have three useless tablets that I paid almost $80 a piece for. I am also giving 1 star for customer service. We contacted Amazon about returning the tablets (pink and purple only because we aren't 100% sure that our son didn't do the damage). They authorized a return for one, but not the other claiming it was out of the 30 day return period. Well, duh. Of course it is. We bought these for Christmas presents and did not wait until the last minute to buy so 30 days pretty much passed before my kids laid hands on the things. Frankly, if you're going to sell crap, you should be prepared to refund money for crap. I don't want to replace crap with more crap. I want my money back so I can buy something worth my money. I will never buy from this seller again. I do not recommend purchasing this tablet or anything else from Tablet Express.","2014-03-11",0

Still wouldn't turn on so I put it aside plugged into power.  Went back to it later and it was on.  It was working normally except it was always tricky to turn on.  Every time I wanted to use it I seemed  to have trouble getting it started. I contacted Tablet Express by email and they had developed a fix for the operating system.  I had to buy a micro SD card to download the file too, and then insert into the tablet and restart tablet.Well guess what. I couldn't get the tablet to start up.  So I got back in touch with the Tablet Express person and was given a different file. I could now start the tablet but it wouldn't update itself.  So I was told to ship the tablet back and they would fix it.  I wrapped it in bubble wrap and shipped it in. I received an email back saying the tablet screen was broken and that it wouldn't be warranty.  They asked me how it had gotten broke. Well during the time I was emailing back and forth I was sending them pictures of the screen that I was seeing. There was no breaks in the screen.  So I feel like I got nothing for my first foray into the tablet world.Thanks Tablet Express for nothing! You got my money and I got your junk.","2014-03-23",0

I ordered the product from Amazon and when i received the product i was very disappointed with it. First of all, the seal was broken (opened), and Amazon has covered the broken seal with another seal of their own. I can clearly say that there were two seals one on top of the other. But they've put the other seal on top of the original broken seal so that it would appear that the product was new and unopened. The second thing is that there was an obvious fingerprint on the device when i opened it, And also some dust inside. The third thing is that the original stickers ( that cover the sides and the back and the screen ) were replaced by a cheap replica and i could tell the difference for they were not placed perfectly onto the product and there were bubbles appearing on the screen sticker. Anyhow, i always doubted amazon selling used product and i said i'll try this time maybe i'm wrong. But i was right. I returned the product and will never trust Amazon again. Always buy from the original company, even if you have to pay a little money on the taxes. It's better than getting a used product.","2014-03-19",0

My kids have had these tablets a week one of the chargers is broken (yes already) The tablet freezes if it works at all, the volume is bad I can't even explain to you... Nothing works! So I go to the manual which is a joke to call it that... as only one of the Zee-pads came with the ""manual"" which is written in broken English to the point it's hard to even comprehend what there trying to say. The tablet is a cheaply made Chinese product missing its correct accessories.. And so I contact the ""seller"" to finally get a reply after chasing butt for days. Oh they will take it back but I have to pay for shipping, I can't get a refund but an exchange after fees and only if they deem no damage was inflicted on the tablet...At this point I can't even cope with this, the tablets are horrible! My kids are in tears and I have no answers for them. I refuse to waste any more money on these things after the $153 to buy them.. I try and refund with Amazon but see here is the catch they were opened ( yes well hello how was I meant to know they where broken) and Amazon only fulfilled shipment so of course I'm stuck with the seller who has no number for me to call. USA wholesale you suck what kind of company doesn't even have a contact number? I can't tell you how bad I feel for my children.. Money does not grow on trees it's not like I can just replace these. I advice anybody considering a tablet for your kids to stay clear of these... iPad, kindle, Nook etc is the way to go...

The specs are great, and I was really thrilled at first, I could sideload apps and the community WAS even able to root, I even HAD live wallpapers.  However, Amazon updates without warning and there is no way to stop updates without losing internet connectivity.  Ultimately, an update broke my device, and even if I had managed to avoid the updates the tablet becomes nearly worthless without internet.  I'm very sorry that I bought from this company when there is another line of devices that would have worked much better for what I wanted and expected.  I wouldn't buy any other Amazon anything, they are worse than apple.  It's my device, I paid for it.  Amazon uses open source software that they get for no cost GNU, Linux, and Android and then they ruin it intentionally to lock in down and limit functionality.  Forcing people to buy from their appstore, stare at ads, and a dull black background.  Many of the apps available from amazon are old versions of apps that I already have paid for and use on my android phone and other devices.  I'm not going to pay again.  Amazon really stabbed us in the back on this one.  I've never had a device that didn't ask first before changing the software not even windows does that unless you op-in and you can always go turn off automatic updates.  Buying this tablet is the same as signing a contract with the devil, they managed to enslave free software and do whatever they want to your device without your approval.  It's not a version of unix like apple uses and pays for, it's Linux and Android and to subvert them like this is criminal.

"28160","Hate it","Mike Bradley","R3OEKGHL9WEG0L","I absolutely hate it. It's basic architecture is such that apps can't communicate productively with each other. As a result, every app has to duplicate computer-like sharing functions that would be trivial in a real computer. Most of the time, they do a miserable job of it. The screen is the best touch screen, so I've read, but that isn't saying much. You often have to keep whacking away at the screen to get it to respond and often the response is for the icon next to the one you're whacking. The whole touch screen user interface is remarkable, but it's very limited. It's simply impossible to make a screen icon or label for even the limited number of actions you can take; the actions for which there's no label/icon are basically secret. You may stumble over them, you may not. You certainly will never have the functionality of a real computer.In spite of all the problems of the iPad and its imitators, many people buy them. If you limit yourself to simple email handling, on the level of what we had 30+ years ago before the web, taking pictures, and browsing web sites while not using them to do much, I suppose the iPad is a decent enough choice. But don't buy a new one. The used ones are half the price and they're in terrific condition.","2014-04-18",0

Very disappointed with this Asus product. Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my son December 14th 2013. After one month of use, the tablet failed to respond. Thinking maybe it was just a defect, I ordered a replacement. The tablet worked great for about 4 months then suddenly stopped working again, now i can't return it because the warranty has expired. I'm basically stuck with a heap of junk that i can do nothing with, only had the item for a total of four months. Now I'm out of a tablet and $144.00. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Take my advise, if you happen to come across one that you're having problems with and you're considering sending in for a replacement, DON'T, get your money back and be done with it. Would give it a rating of zero if i could.","2014-04-08",0

I love the kindle product just not the so called refurbished one's.The guy at tech support told me there was no repair option for my kindle and that i would have to buy another one. No big deal mine was over 2 years old. He then talked me into the certified refurbished one. I recieved it and it was awesome. Everything I was expecting it to be. Atleast for the first 2 days. Then the screen had lines going through it. I Iet it sit for 2 hours on the charger then went back to it to find the screen was normal. That lasted 20 minutes and then there were lines through the screen again to the point of where you could not make out what you were looking at. I contacted amazon and they rushed me another one out. Right out of the box had issues with the operating hardware. at least thats what they said when I contacted tech support. To which I asked ""Souldn't that have been caught during the certified inspection part?"" the reply was evasive and they said they would send me another one right out. I have opted out of thier so called ""certified refurbished"" exchange program where the only thing certified is that they will pay the shipping to get you another one until YOU find them a returned one that works.

"77845","Excellent Tablet with Two Horrible Flaws","Anon","R4FRRW6ZJ7SN","I purchased this Tablet because:  * I purchased an Xperia Z Ultra phone, was completely blown away, and decided ""I want a Sony Tablet instead of an IPad.""When I first got this Tablet, I was impressed -- it was thin, well built, and looked just like a bigger Xperia Z Ultra -- exactly what I wanted.Then, I raw into the following problems:  * the (thin) stylus that works on the Xperia Z Ultra does NOT work on the Xperia Z Tablet -- whatever magic was used to make pencils work as stylus on the Xperia Z Ultra was NOT applied to the Xperia Z Tablet. I'm not counting this against it as it's my fault for not researching this earlier.  * it's laggy -- I understand that this CPU is a QuadCore 1.5 GHZ -- and 1.5 GHZ is sorta slow by modern standards -- however, the UI is laggy + jitters -- I found it physically uncomfortable  * worst of all: with the Xperia Tablet plugged into a micro-usb charger -- I can LOSE CHARGE while using the tablet. Yes, let me repeat this again:  * I'm using the Tablet  * The tablet is plugged in via Microusb. The microusb is connected to a wall outlet (not my computer)  * I'm losing battery charge.  This last point makes me really unhappy -- as I intended to use the tablet as an input device for the PC. Well, it doesn't really work if my input device is LOSING CHARGE while connected to a microusb->wall.I consider these two flaws ""fatal"" in the sense that:  * if there's sufficient lag to make me uncomfortable, it's not really usable  * and if I'm losing charge when I connect it to the wall and use it, it limits my use casesBesides the above, I can find nothing wrong with the tablet.","2014-04-27",0

"64459","Should've Just Bought Some Books","Cory","R17QPMO6A5Z3GM","I was replacing an original iPad and decided on a Kindle Fire. It failed in every way. The first one would not charge and was replaced. The second one takes about 36 hours to reach 90% charged and only about 12 hours to return to 0% even if I'm not using it much.But how does it perform?  Horribly. The built in Silk Browser for the internet freezes then crashes every 15 minutes or so. The apps available are meager. I added a few magazine subscriptions, but each time there's a new issue it has forgotten about my subscription and I have to go through the whole process again. Even when it knows I'm subscribed it always looks like they're about to charge me for the issue. YouTube videos are either the size of a business card or have the comments superimposed over half the video.The Kindle Lending Library available with Prime offers thousands of books to borrow, none of which you would ever want to borrow. I was upset when I found out I could only borrow one book per month, even if I finished it earlier. Then I realized that wasn't such a problem since I honestly couldn't find two books I wanted to borrow from the selection available.Reading a book on the Kindle is a decent experience. You can select any word and it gives you the definition. That is the nicest thing I can say about the whole device.I guess it balances out - the battery doesn't last, it crashes constantly, but it doesn't have any content I want to use, so it just sits on my coffee table. I don't know if it's charged. But it's a safe bet that it's not.","2014-04-13",0

So as you can guess, the actual box the nexus came in was scratched up an dented in pretty deep. So all that aside, when i opened the nexus box the plastic that comes on the tablet looked like it had been used, it was also scratched an sticky. Smh, and sadly it goes on. When i took off the plastic, i proceeded to turn the tablet on. Turned the tablet on, an in the middle of the screen there was a vertical digital line! nothing was wrong with the background but, anything you do on the tablet had that digital vertical line down the middle. I initially sent an email to the seller an received no response back. So looked up their number an gave them a call. When i finally got someone on the phone, they told me that they do not repair or replace. They told me all they could do was refund my money to amazon an then amazon would refund it back to me, then politely added in that it would take a minimum of two months before i would receive my money.

"84420","Not a secure device","Sclark","RM5PVQMEOK68P","I ordered the Kindle Fire HDX, based on all of the favorable reviews.  My only complaint is that the device is not secure, right out of the box.  While the Kindle may be great at what it is intended to do, I pretty much rejected it due to a lack of security and regard to my Amazon account.  I am writing this review as a word of caution to others who may order it:When you order the Kindle, Amazon will ask you if you want to pre-register it.  They are doing this as there were many complaints of registrations failing after customers received the device, so they pre-register it for you before shipping, to cut down the amount of calls to their support.  The bad part of this is that, straight out of the box, you can click on ""Shop Amazon"" and go straight into your account.  The app, or the Kindle itself, does not ask for your credentials.  What this means is that my Kindle could have been mis-delivered, someone could have opened the box, powered on the Kindle, and had immediate access to my Amazon account (settings, Order History....everything).  I was even able to go shopping and could have made purchases, all without being prompted for my account credentials.Even with a passcode lock on the device, once registered and accessed, the Kindle prompts you no further for your Amazon credentials.  For some folks this might be OK, but for others who loan their Kindle to their kids, friends, or are just plain security conscious, this may be an issue for them.  It would be nice to see Amazon step up security and regard for customer's privacy on their portable devices.","2014-04-30",0

The touch screen is sluggish, the response time is slow (and there's nothing wrong with my WiFi) and compared to the resolution of the screens on other tablets out there, it's average at best. One piece of advice - do not, whatever you do - let the battery go below 10% because if it does out entirely, you may never get it started again.  The charger adapter is finicky, and once in a while the tablet will just not start up.  At all. You'll have to find a thumbtack, flip the thing over, and stick it in the ""reset"" hole on the back of the machine. And even then, you may have to do it more than once. I bought this because I didn't want to spend twice the amount on a higher-end tablet... TRUST me when I say it's worth the extra money.

"89692","Minuses outweigh the plusses","Michael J. Lipphardt","R32KOT5ABY3B34","I have several items I use to read Kindle books and watch movies on.  One was the HDX 7.  I also us a second gen Nexus 7 and iPad Mini Retina.  Often I use a smartphone, like a Note 3 or Icon.  I will compare the HDX7 to these.First is screen.  I nailing this because this is the big problem.  This is supposed to be a book reader.  But that purple/violet glow intruding into the readable space is awful.  And it does not disappear regardless of your background settings - black, amber (my favorite) or white, it's always there.  Sadly it's MOST apparent in amber, which color is otherwise the easiest on your eyes.As a video display device, for movies and such it seems much better.  I suspect it's just not as noticeable with things going on on-screen.  It's there, but doesn't seem as bothersome.  But the screen is why I returned it.  Of the devices I mention, the best screen by a long way is the Nexus 7.  It's a nice reader.  Far better than the HDX.  The iPad came in last because while screen res is fine, you cannot get a decent sepia from it.  Sepia is nearly white.  Oddly. the iPad supports that cool page turn animation while the Android and WP and even the Kindle do not.As for watching movies, I think I have to give the nod to the iPad.  Sound is good on the iPad - nearly as good as the HDX.  Make no mistake, the HDX sounds great.  I hate to be repetitive, but that damn screen really sucks.  If you read the other reviews, it gets hammered for that constantly and Amazon pawns off some lame excuse about how their great display technology is so wonderful you should be happy to pay the price of that violet glow.  Well, the display is nice in the center.  But it's no better than the N7.  So, sound and display for movies goes to iPad, plus you can download your movies to the iPad just like the HDX.  You cannot, unfortunately, watch videos on Android.  Why Amazon doesn't allow this is stupid and beyond me.  You cannot BUY movies from iPad, but that is the only disadvantage there.As for use as a tablet - the HDX is very clearly focused on use as entertainment, centered on Amazon.  There is little there that is free, unlike Android or iPad.  What is available is available ONLY through Amazon.  You cannot use Google Play to fetch apps.As far as performance goes, no quibbles.  The HDX screams.  It's very fast and smooth.  But then so are the other tabs, with the N7 being slightly slower.So, the summary.  If you were able to buy titles using the iPad, I'd say forget the HDX.  Get an iPad.  It's a far better general purpose tab than the HDX, and every bit as good as the HDX for movies and reading.  If you could WATCH movies on the N7, I'd say get that.  It has the best reading display of the three, and not being locked in to Amazon is a huge benefit.  If all you care about is consuming Amazon content and that purple hell-glow is OK with you, then get the HDX.  It's the smallest of the devices, with a slightly larger screen than the N7 (not as big as the iPad though) with good sound.  If Amazon ever gets it's head out of the sand, stops trying to convince everyone that the screen is actually OK, really it is, and FIXES IT, I will buy it again just for reading and movies.  Everything about it is great.  Except of course it's main component, it's reason for being, which sucks.","2014-04-11",0

I have done all the fixes Amazon has provided to no avail. The Kindle shuts off and  knocks me off the internet constantly. It gets really hot and freezes all the time. I don't even enjoy using it. If I had to do it over I would not purchase this again. I also have the 7 inch and I have no problems with it. I have asked Amazon for a credit  or a refund to use on something else but they refused. They just want to keep replacing it with a new one and it still doesn't work. So I guess I'm stuck with it.","2014-04-28",0

"25970","Hate it","Mike Bradley","R3OEKGHL9WEG0L","I absolutely hate it. It's basic architecture is such that apps can't communicate productively with each other. As a result, every app has to duplicate computer-like sharing functions that would be trivial in a real computer. Most of the time, they do a miserable job of it. The screen is the best touch screen, so I've read, but that isn't saying much. You often have to keep whacking away at the screen to get it to respond and often the response is for the icon next to the one you're whacking. The whole touch screen user interface is remarkable, but it's very limited. It's simply impossible to make a screen icon or label for even the limited number of actions you can take; the actions for which there's no label/icon are basically secret. You may stumble over them, you may not. You certainly will never have the functionality of a real computer.In spite of all the problems of the iPad and its imitators, many people buy them. If you limit yourself to simple email handling, on the level of what we had 30+ years ago before the web, taking pictures, and browsing web sites while not using them to do much, I suppose the iPad is a decent enough choice. But don't buy a new one. The used ones are half the price and they're in terrific condition.","2014-04-18",0

"19019","""But when she was good...""","bill flanagan","R14IUOO73SYD5L","Product: 4 StarsUSB Connector: 0 StarsAmazon Customer Service: Black hole.This was my wife's first tablet. It was a snap to set up and worked well. It was ridiculously easy for a person more interested in content than technology to become even more of an avid Amazon customer than she had been before. We recommended it to our friends and relatives, at least 3 of whom immediately bought it as well. In fact we had 2 at one time. I traded mine for an older iPad 1 with a slightly damaged but usable first generation iPad; In the time I had it, I liked it. Unlike the Kindle Fire, I can still charge it and gets used daily.Amazon did a great job integrating Google's Android OS into their customer universe. Although it's a pretty old version of the android OS at this point, it does its job. In this case, Amazon built on something that worked and, for their customers, made it better. Good job.IF ONLY Google had designed the stupid USB power connector that now serves as a hinge to let the USB cord swing like a pendulum beneath it. Maybe we would be posting the previously deserved 5 star review rather than this 1 star tear.I'll probably be considered an ingrate for having a product a long time and then have it stop at the end of its useful life. The small crack on the screen of my now VERY old iPad is the only thing wrong wit hit. It holds a charge for days and still works with the older 4.x apps that we have on it. When it stops being useful as it is, it will be retired to my bedside as an alarm clock.What really makes me mad is that the Amazon Kindle Fire that has no cracks and a battery that still holds a charge, in theory, will probably never be used again. The USB connector on this unit broke, just like the one this unit was sent to us as a replacement for.The Amazon rep had the nerve to say that the USB problem, one we have lived with for along time now, playing with the USB for an eternity until the little lightning bolt tells us that it is charging, was something they had really not heard of as a problem.Amazon, if you can make flying delivery drones or hire flying moneys as stand-ins until then, why can't you stand behind your defective product? This was clearly a work-in-progress that allowed you to better know the market and develop the latest HDX which, by all accounts is rated as good as if not better than an iPad.We bought weeks after the product announcement. From what we read in the press, Amazon would sell at a loss if needed just to continue to grow their dominance in the book, music, and video markets.By saying we read books on this device, Amazon should know that we are, like many other reader, literate enough to read the scores of posting on the web about the problems with their charging port. It is a PRODUCT DEFECT and not a an issue of owner negligence. Our car still has a gas cap after 11 years. If it falls off, we can order an easy to install replacement on Amazon for it .Look at YouTube: there are so many videos explaining how to replace the USB port that it's almost funny. The glitch is that you need to know how to micro-solder at least 4 contacts onto the circuit board that is secured with a few dozen screws in the bowels of the device. The screws, I can handle. But spending $10 to $15 on Amazon for a replacement micro USB socket then dedicating a weekend to getting it in place is not in the cards.One online repair firm charges $39.50 to do it. They claim replacement isn't the problem: in their experience many of their repairs came back to them not because of the quality of their connection but because there never was any mechanical stability in the first place and have to improvise to glue or solder on additional stiffeners to keep it from recurring.When I called Amazon, after telling me that this was a rare if not unheard of problem that is just part of having a consumer electronic product, they quickly offered to sell me a new more recent device for around $120.This isn't customer service. This is inventory management: the unit they offered to sell for that price was the previous generation product an not the current one generating rave reviews. Using people dumb enough to buy a first generation product as the dumping ground for left over previous year devices isn't a sign of respect for people who just want to continue to want to buy stuff from Amazon.I am really sorry, Amazon. I know this review will be discounted as just another crank selling sour grapes. I just had to say something after my recent call. I don't like to be told that what I read and experience is new and unique or gleaned from the yammerings of other malcontents.Grow up and deal with us as client and not as rubes. Tell your service people not to use their own experience to justify why our problem is unique (""I have the same model and I've never had a problem with it...""). At least give them a script to read that doesn't make people with legitimate issues feel that we're wrong about what we know.*** This review was NOT written on my Kindle Fire...

Other reviewers have already reviewed the great points about it so I won't rehash them because I loved all the features, especially the stylus. My problem with it started two months into owning it. I might had ended up with a lemon but I still feel I should report it. After two months, out of nowhere, the battery started draining unreasonably fast. I'm talking, 1% every 30 seconds when it wasn't in airplane mode. The battery lasted longer when it was in airplane mode but not much. I wouldn't be able to sit through an hour and a half movie. For one more month I did everything I could think of to isolate the problem including reformatting it a dozen times, using various size SD cards, using different cases in case it had to do with overheating... and yes, it did run hot when the battery drained... but none of the above worked. It was to the point where 30% drainage would occur suddenly sometimes and before I knew it, I was under 10%. It was unreasonable and so frustrating, I had no choice but to return it.Kudos to Amazon for having a great return policy. I give them 5 starts for being understanding.","2014-04-27",0

"83453","Horrible.. DO NOT BUY!!!!!","Cindi","RG8IUQIMOJMYW","If you have constant internet access and don't have to worry about paying for usage, then this wouldn't be terrible.I had the older version for years and was happy with it. I use my cell phone for wireless internet because I don't have other options where I live so I have to worry about data usage. I bought the 64GB because I wanted space to download movies and apps because my 3yr old can't stream movies do to our data usage issues. Even though I PURCHASED these movies and DOWNLOADED them to my kindle, my three year old can't watch them now unless I take the kindle to a place that has a stronger internet connection than my cell phone and go into each of the 50 or so movies to 'reset' them because the kindle will start giving her an error message that she needs an internet connection to watch the movies (even though they are downloaded on the kindle!!). Also... even when connected to the internet, I often go into my purchased movies and don't get the option to play the movies. I have to go in and out of the movies a couple times to get the 'play' button to show up. I have also found this unit to be slow and unresponsive.I initially purchased this Kindle in Jan 2014. In less than a week I was calling support because it kept crashing. I had to reset to factory conditions and redownload everything twice in the first two weeks. After two weeks of fighting with the initial purchase Amazon support suggested replacing the unit for me. When they did, they sent me a refurbished one (I had purchased a new one). They refused to send me a new one as replacement so I am now stuck with a piece of crap somebody else already sent back.One of the features I liked most about the old Kindle was Kindle Free Time... this is now crap. You have to have an internet connection to even use it. Kindle Free Time is advertised as a safe way for kids to use the Kindle without worries about them accidentally going on the web or purchasing things. But you now need an internet connection to even use it. So my 3yr old has to use they kindle without free time. She is constantly getting error messages and accidentally buying stuff because she hits wrong buttons. I have to watch my bank account very carefully and call Amazon to reverse everything she buys. This kindle is a constant headache. If she didn't love the games and movies so much, and if I had the money to re-buy all the movies/apps for some other tablet I would in a heartbeat. Unfortunately I am stuck with this piece of junk. I hope this review saves somebody else the headaches.","2014-05-15",0

Google was no help and told me to call Asus. Asus gave me an RMA number and I have to return it at my own expense for warranty repair. Btw, they say they may send you a re-manufactured or re-certified device in its place.....I have a screen protector on the device which will ruin the protector if I remove it, so I guess that is also more money down the drain.

"121417","Stopped charging after 1.5 months! I WOULD BUY A DIFFERENT TABLET","Darrell B","R11U4K2SY1S44","FIrst, I have yet to contact HP or Amazon about any problems, so this review will be revised as my problems are fixed.That said, my tablet worked perfectly up until last night. I haven't used it for much other than reading and watching a few shows. The battery had been working fine and holding a nice, long charge. Until last night that is... I had my charging cord plugged into a surge protector in my room, and that's the only place I had ever recharged the tablet. I watched one show and the battery was down to about 12%, so I decided to get the charger, as well as an extension cord, since the supplied recharging cord is a mere 3ft long. Well, I plugged it all in and nothing happened. I plugged it in multiple outlets, including the surge protector I'd always used, and still, nothing. Restarted it and tried again, shut it down twice and tried again, no charging. So, I'm done trying myself.When I first received the tablet, I thought how flimsy and short the recharging cord was, was disheartening. Seriously, all electronics companies seem to be cutting costs by shortening the power cords. I guess they want us running new outlets or running extension cords all over our houses. Then, the stupid tablet doesn't even tell you it's charging. Sure, it has a little white LED that goes on and off when you turn on or off the tablet and even blinks for a split second when you connect the charger, but it doesn't stay on continuously to let you know how the charging is going or to let you know its fully powered. Seems like engineering 101 was skipped here.Anyway, I'm not sure how I'll resolve this issue. I'll check with HP and Amazon and see what they can do. I may try to get a refund and find a device that seems sturdier. It's not like they can reconfigure my hardware and give me a sturdier power port and charging cable. This review will update as soon as my issues are resolved.Update: HP sent me a replacement charger after doing zero actual diagnostics and telling me that there was no problem with the tablet but there was a problem with the charger. HP customer service was friendly and helpful, slightly hard to understand, but the phone call took 40 mins just to get a new charger. It took about a week to receive my new charger after it sat at a the local Fedex distribution center for three days. That was annoying. When I finally received the charger and tried it out, it worked!...For about two weeks!!! I planned on just exchanging this product from Amazon but I'm passed the 30 day window so I guess Ill go through HP again and see if they can do something better this time. I WOULD NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF I WERE YOU. Maybe I got a lemon, but two chargers in two months? Thats ridiculous.","2014-05-17",0
"96093","Don't waste your money on Kindle Fire!","Kindle Customer","R1UZ86VHU5XRI","Yes, the screen resolution is very good...but that is the only redeeming quality this device has going for it! Consistently turns off and restarts while gaming or reading. It is very frustrating! Just download the Kindle app onto whatever quality tablet or phone you own or purchase and you will be much happier. The limit that Amazon has placed on acquiring apps is also a good reason to purchase an actual tablet and put the reader onto it. There also is no sd slot so every time you want to add movies or music you have to connect to a computer. I have purchased cheap 7 inch Android tablets which have been very dependable and worth the $75  that I spent. I am very disappointed in this device and wish I had gone with my gut and bought a galaxy or something. I normally don't write reviews however I felt like this was important to possibly help one person make an informed decision.","2014-05-18",0

"123424","Only slightly better, double the price.","Ai Wintermute","R3O7B8NMWPT8EX","I have been using a Toshiba Encore for months as my primary computer, using a Y cable with power and a dock.  These Bay Trail machines are very capable devices.  However at the writing of this review, the TP8 has been out for nearly 5 months, and Lenovo cant even deliver them.Now that the Encore is $205 with prime shipping, it makes the TP8 even more pointless.Starting with the so called benefits:1920X1200 res screen:  At first glance, this seems like a really positive benefit of getting the TP8 over any other 8"" Windows 8.1 device, however after using Windows 8.1 on such a tiny display with that resolution, it quickly becomes a disadvantage.  Its hard enough using standard legacy windows apps at 1280x800, the same apps at 1920x1200 on such a small screen, become unusable with a finger.USB 3.0:  Sure, USB 3.0 is much faster than USB 2.0, who wouldn't buy this machine to gain that extra speed?  Oh... Wait... The USB port is also the POWER PORT, so when you get home and you want to plug your dock in, plug in your large monitor, keyboard, mouse, external hard drives, etc.  Suddenly you realize that you cant POWER THE MACHINE...  A problem with EVERY 8"" Windows tablet and clearly Lenovo put no thought into this, even though they advertise it with a ""DESKTOP MODE"".  MORONIC!Z3770 CPU:  Yes, its faster than the other devices using the Z3740, but only marginally, NOT worth more than DOUBLE THE PRICE.Lenovo could have released a very good competitor to the market place, instead they bring a slightly better machine at double the price and even then, they cant even deliver that.LENOVO HAS FALLEN SO FAR, SINCE THE CHINESE BOUGHT THEM...","2014-05-19",0

"124289","Glamorous piece of junk.","Krishnamurthy Rajagopal","RABRLF5Q2UDAF","Major issue with file transfer from USB to Micro SD cardWanted to transfer files from USB Hard drive (128 GB FAT 32) to Micro SD card (64 GB). It worked fine for few files and then transfer failed. I copied HD movie file and mp4 video files, transfer worked for few files then stopped.  The tablet recognizes the SD card and USB drive and I can view data and play files from the USB Drive and also shows SD card.. so nothing  wrong with  USB or micro SD card . But the transfer of the files failed after the transfer of few files. I formatted the SD disk and again try to copy from USB to Micro SD card and it failed again.  I took my system to best buy Samsung Re. They also tried and could not transfer the files from the USB to micro SD card. They called the Samsung technical consultant who gave a ridiculous answer that the system cannot be used for file transfers. So what I am supposed to do with this tablet ? Just browse net and download games ...? I wanted to store video files and photo albums on SD card by transfer from USB drive and watch them when I am in a place where I do not have internet access and also use this for my video presentation. But,  could not make this work.  I spent hours to resolve and even best buy Samsung representative tried their best but failed.In a nutshell FILE TRANSFER FROM USB TO MICRO SD CARD DOES NOT WORK.  I have not tested the display ability on large screen as I do not have the connector. For me this tablet is glamorous piece of junk. I would call Samsung tech support myself and see if this get resolved.I talked to Samsung Tech support and they concluded my SD card to be defective( which I purchased from Costco a day ago). It is weird that micro SD worked for few hours then gets screwed for some reasons. I went to best buy purchased another SD card and tested. For now I am able to copy from the USB drive to Micro SD card. Let me see how this goes and would update my review.","2014-05-26",0

"63806","Loved it at first... but it died 3 months after the One Year Warranty","ShellyP","R2IFMN9AL2F72F","I loved my Kindle.  But I am very disappointed that 3 months after my warranty was up - my Kindle froze on the Kindle Fire screen with no apparent reason (I am very careful with this as a I use it every day).  When calling Customer Service, after trying to re-set it 900 times to no avail I was told that basically I can have a ""discounted"" price on a refurbished Kindle Replacement... and a $30.00 off certificate.  For me, that answer was not good enough and it never will be.As a pretty loyal customer to AMAZON I am extremely disappointed and am considering cancelling PRIME and finding other avenues for online ordering that have nothing to do with AMAZON.  This includes Zappos I believe.  Anyway, unfortunately there are few things I still need so I will be placing a couple more orders - but I'm not sure about after that.Also, why would I want the same KINDLE back when it only lasted a year and a half.  I think now I should have just taken my $300 and put it towards the iPAD.  Although more expensive, I know it would last and there would be more technical help available.  However it probably wouldn't be needed as I most likely wouldn't have this issue with it.I am appalled that I have read numerous complaints about the same issue with the Kindle, but yet AMAZON doesn't seem to think it's a problem with their Software.Pay the extra money for a table that will last.","2014-05-14",0

Yes, I bought it, and yes, it arrived on time, but after that the experience has pretty much been downhill. My 8-year-old, super-responsible son (who saved his money for a year to buy a tablet) bought this - and within 2 days the glass was scratched up just from sliding your fingers around (which is supposed to be what you do with a touch screen). The charger port doesn't fit very well - so he asks me to plug it in so it doesn't get bent and rendered unuseable. If you want a cheap throw-away for a 3 year-old that will break anything you put in front of them anyway, then go ahead and buy several - you'll need to, these won't last even if used with care...","2014-05-19",0

"122678","Stylus integrtaion good.  Poor execution, poor customer service","KLK","R2B3HQVFCTNG7E","Nice idea in theory.  The stylus helps navigate the Desktop Windows OS.Not long after I purchased it, the front camera, ambient light sensor, microphone, and headphone all went out.  I spent hours trying to figure out why until it seemed to be obviously a hardware issue.  Went back and forth with ASUS phone and online support, was first told to reset the device (which they seem always to suggest as the first step)-which I'd already done.  Then an RMA (ship back for repair) was suggested; I had to take it to UPS and ship it across the country at my own expense.  For days, until I wrote to ask them where it was, there was no online acknowledgment that the device had been received.Eventually, it was sent back to me with the hardware issues fixed but Windows reinstalled.  I had to call Microsoft to activate Office, having previously had to reset the device so many times.  Then I discovered that Windows was not activated, so I got back in touch with tech support, and was told to reset the device yet again.  Can't understand why this wasn't done during the RMA.If you're used to high-resolution phones/tablets, the 1280x800 relatively dim screen is also a striking downgrade. Many stylus taps are also not recognized, and you also have to push hard enough with the stylus at times that you worry you're damaging the screen.Wish I had not purchased this or that I'd returned it via Amazon.  This has been a waste of my time and money.","2014-05-06",0

Buy a Kindle Fire to get a real brand name behind the purchase (for whatever that's worth these days)I purchased one of these for my high school daughter for lesson plans last August.  She used & enjoyed it daily through Christmas, but then the headphone jack died.  I told her to live with it as the unit worked for the stated purpose and the speakers still played (always very low).  In March the unit started sticking in a boot loop.  I brought it up in diagnostic boot and found the internal memory had stopped functioning so the OS was not there to load.  I called the warranty number but nobody in California ever answered (just hold music).  I'd get a call back the next day and an answer to emails, so I assume that required daylight in China not 9-5PST as stated.  They were NICE.  After two weeks of email, I did get a repair ticket & I mailed it back.  They did replace it last month on the 24th.  Fair enough and any small electronic can be bad.  This unit was a newer operating system and faster  --BUT ---Within 10 days the unit no longer functioned at all, not even diagnostic boot.  I will probably just trash it or crack it open to see the poor assembly quality out of curiosity.  Many of these are assembled with masking tape inside.  That's 2 that are bad.

The limit that Amazon has placed on acquiring apps is also a good reason to purchase an actual tablet and put the reader onto it. There also is no sd slot so every time you want to add movies or music you have to connect to a computer.

"72882","Good decision to buy!","irishjdf","R8W7308FCEBQJ","Updated June 11, 2014 - I am updating this review because i don't feel it is honest. Shortly after i posted this review and having been able to play with the device for a while, I returned it for a refund. I didn't understand why i couldn't find a Youtube app or Google Earth. I quickly realized that although this was an ""android"" tablet it was controlled. I looked at the IPad Mini Retina and considered buying it. But there is one factor to why i wanted a small tablet. I have a full size IPad Air which is use for every day stuff. When i want to sit back and relax or watch videos b/f i fall asleep i want a smaller tablet. I have severe heart failure that was caused by a virus. My circulation is a big factor and holding anything up for a long time results in losing feeling in my arm. An iPad Mini was out of the question.  I purchased a Nexus 7 2013 and it was amazing. It was fast and light and I could watch Youtube and use the google apps, but there is no app for access to my Amazon Prime. I was in Best Buy and walked past the Kindle Fire display and stopped for a moment. What i quickly realized was that the HDX screen and colors are more vivid than the Nexus 7. It also responded quicker. An employee that was working there asked if i needed help and I explained that this was the tablet i really wanted but there is not Youtube. You can download a ""fix"" and install Youtube but it does NOT allow you to log into the Google environment. He told me about the Youtube Video app that he said was actually better than Youtube and allowed you to log in to Google to load your subscriptions, favorites, etc. There is also an Instagram alternative app. I decided to buy it and i can tell side by side the difference in speed and color between the Kindle Fire HDX and the Google Nexus 7 2013..the Kindle Fire HDX blows it away. I have adapted to the apps that it doesn't have because i have an iPad for backup. But so far its perfect. The sound difference when listening to music is much better than the Nexus also.The perfect choice for a 7"" tablet. Remember most Android tablets don't have access to the Amazon Instant Store. Its fast, has very sharp vivid screen and images, and has all the apps you need. Youtube can indeed be run through the browser.","2014-01-04",1

Though I would prefer that Amazon just use the Google Play store she gets along well enough with Amazon's app store, despite the fact that common apps such as Google Chrome are missing.The Kindle also has some annoying limitations on customization. My wife wanted to change the background to a picture but apparently that feature is not implemented for some odd reason. She also wanted to rename it from Kindle #2 but apparently that is not allowed either. I think the tradeoff in being easy to use might have overstepped a bit here, as asking to put your own pictures on as a background shouldn't really be an issue, nor should renaming it to be more personally named be such an issue either. Perhaps a future upgrade will address these easy-to-fix usability issues.As to whether or not I would get her this again I would go with ""definitely"". Despite the missing features and apps this is a solid tablet that I feel will stand up to her use for many years.","2014-01-01",1

"75827","Superb","H. S. Miller ""insatiable reader""","R5RF0EHMAKRZ8","I have gotten every 7"" Fire as it came out.  All have been a pleasurable experience, but this HDX has exceeded all my expectations by far!  I was reluctant to get it as I only expected a software update and a few added gizmos.  I had hoped they would include another camera on it too, but no.What pushed me over the edge in purchasing it was a $50 coupon sent to me as a Prime customer, plus the knowledge I could sell my older HD Fire and recoup even more of the purchase price so it seemed to be worth a major software upgrade, all by itself.WOW!  Holy computational power, Batman!!!  I am more than delighted with this 7"" HDX!  The total difference between the older Fire HD generation one and this Fire HDX is amazing!  Incredible value here!  My only regret is that it doesn't support Flash, but neither did the HD unless you sideloaded Dolphin, and for the most part I can do without having Flash on it.  I do hope a software upgrade will enable Flash videos on it, and soon, but with the outstanding performance and speed of the HDX as it is, I can live without having Flash.  Besides, what a lot of people don't realize is, if you use any other OS (in order to view Flash) rather than the Amazon version, you lose all the great benefits of Amazon's cloud loading and storage, which is part of the reason for it's speed and super flexibility.This HDX is a true world-beater.  I can't imagine what even newer models could provide in addition except another camera on the 7"" model.  I have not used the Mayday help feature, but since I've used Fires from the very beginning I'm used to handling the OS.  I can see where the Mayday help feature could be absolutely invaluable to a beginning purchaser, though.  You get help on the spot and instantly.","2014-01-27",1

I took the Kindle out of the box, plugged it in and synced up with my router and was up and running in no time. If you can read directions you can set this up without a problem. I actually watched Downton Abbey first episode from Amazon Prime and it was incredible. Picture quality is outstanding, and the sound is fantastic.

There is so much I can do with it and I haven't even figured it all out yet.

"98898","Loving it!","OKchic","R2EKC925UXE0ZA","I am really enjoying my new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.  I have had a original Fire, and 2012 Fire HD 7"". I wasn't really sure I could justify the upgrade this time, but I had wanted a little larger screen for a long time and really wanted one. I am glad I did. I had a little problem with the first one I received, but called and Amazon got me a replacement on the way immediately. I was able to use the first one until the replacement arrived and then sent back. This one is great. I love the great display, and I really love how light it is! I got a semi hard plastic shell type back for mine so it added almost no weight, after trying some other cases. I just slide that into a sleeve to put in my purse. It is so light weight for the size and is really comfortable to hold for long periods. I am a huge reader and listener of my Amazon Ebooks, so I love how seamlessly it works and syncs with my Kindle Paperwhite and other Fire HD. I actually had tried a Samsung Note for a few days, thinking I would try something different, but I am too much of an Amazon gal, and my books not being available to listen to easily for my commutes just was not working for me. The new Fire HDX is noticeably faster than the HD. I also love that it is much faster and with no interruptions when viewing Prime videos. I have had almost no problems with that. It sounds great and the videos are crisp and clear. I got a Bluetooth speaker I use some when I am up doing stuff around the house, so I can listen to my books or music. It is quickly becoming my constant companion. I was concerned about the lack of the Google play store just like many others. That is the main reason I tried the Samsung first. I do believe however, that the Amazon app store is improving all the time and for what I do, I have adequate apps. I do have a Samsung phone, so I do have access on it for anything I would run across that I couldn't get on my Fire. I think most people will be pleased. Give it a try! I am really glad I went ahead and got one. I haven't used my laptop in ages!","2014-01-17",1

I now spend more time with this Kindle because using it is so easy...no glitches.  One of the things I appreciate with the upgrade is the improved keyboard. You can easily find a comma. Some friends encouraged me to download some interactive games like Iconmania, Heads Up Charades, and True or False, which we have all played together. I watched a movie with very smooth streaming.

I have a Galaxy S3, so I immediately decided a Samsung tablet would be what I purchased. I would not, however, pay $400 for it (I bought it on a lightning deal for around $340) for a few reasons.No home button - I didn't think this would bother me. Turns out, it does, and I'm glad it's something they included with the 2014 edition. If the screen goes dead, you have to press the power button, and since I have a lock on my tablet, I have to go through that again. If an app freezes (which happens occasionally, but not often) you have to use the power button instead of having a button to return you to the home screen. This is my biggest issue with this tablet.S-Pen is lacking a feature I would have liked, which would be to turn off sensing my fingers/hands/skin. I bought this tablet for note taking and drawing, but it's almost a chore because the screen constantly skips around when I try to use the S-Pen with it because my hand or wrist rests on the tablet as well. It's annoying. I know some app's allow you to turn off the sensitivity, but I shouldn't have to pay $4.99 for something to do what my tablet should.No swype. I know, I know. It's a tablet. But sometimes I just want to use swype when holding the tablet vertically. Swype isn't installed, and you have to buy the app. Doesn't work for me.Those are pretty much my only flaws. I do love this tablet and I don't regret purchasing it at all.","2014-01-09",1

"79753","Loving it!","OKchic","R2EKC925UXE0ZA","I am really enjoying my new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.  I have had a original Fire, and 2012 Fire HD 7"". I wasn't really sure I could justify the upgrade this time, but I had wanted a little larger screen for a long time and really wanted one. I am glad I did. I had a little problem with the first one I received, but called and Amazon got me a replacement on the way immediately. I was able to use the first one until the replacement arrived and then sent back. This one is great. I love the great display, and I really love how light it is! I got a semi hard plastic shell type back for mine so it added almost no weight, after trying some other cases. I just slide that into a sleeve to put in my purse. It is so light weight for the size and is really comfortable to hold for long periods. I am a huge reader and listener of my Amazon Ebooks, so I love how seamlessly it works and syncs with my Kindle Paperwhite and other Fire HD. I actually had tried a Samsung Note for a few days, thinking I would try something different, but I am too much of an Amazon gal, and my books not being available to listen to easily for my commutes just was not working for me. The new Fire HDX is noticeably faster than the HD. I also love that it is much faster and with no interruptions when viewing Prime videos. I have had almost no problems with that. It sounds great and the videos are crisp and clear. I got a Bluetooth speaker I use some when I am up doing stuff around the house, so I can listen to my books or music. It is quickly becoming my constant companion. I was concerned about the lack of the Google play store just like many others. That is the main reason I tried the Samsung first. I do believe however, that the Amazon app store is improving all the time and for what I do, I have adequate apps. I do have a Samsung phone, so I do have access on it for anything I would run across that I couldn't get on my Fire. I think most people will be pleased. Give it a try! I am really glad I went ahead and got one. I haven't used my laptop in ages!","2014-01-17",1

"72674","The best Kindle yet","Ronald G. Glover","R11Y0SSS2UC93W","I am a voracious reader, as is my wife.  We each have Kindle E-readers.  She likes her Paperwhite Kindle very much, but when I had one, I did not care for it.  I borrowed my Granddaughter's first generation Kindle Fire and liked it, so bought a first generation Kindle Fire HD.  I liked the concept, but had so much trouble with failures with them (I had and sent back 3 of them), that I got to know the tech support people pretty well.  I kept the last Fire HD I had since it semi-worked.  Finally, however, with much trepidation (and a $50 one day price drop) I purchased the new Kindle Fire HDX.  It has proven perfect.  It has not crashed nor given me blank pages or any of the myriad problems I had with my Fire HDs.I had read of complaints with blue/purple borders on the HDX, but I did not see it with mine.  My wife said she saw a faint blue tinge at the edges, but it was not bothersome.  I use my HDX almost exclusively for reading and I prefer the black background with white printing so blue/purple borders are not an issue anyhow.I think if you have been disappointed with the first generation Fire HD you will be pleased with the HDX, at least as an E-reader.","2014-01-28",1

"111770","VERY Nice Tablet","Whacko Wayneo ""lawayne""","R1CK68N6OYIVFG","Not near as elegant a physical design as the Apple Air iPad, but the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 is reasonably well-designed.  The operating system beats the iPad hands-down; more complex to learn, but is so much more flexible and powerful.  Apps can be highly integrated with the Android 4.2 operating system, unlike the iPad.  I have a Samsung Note 3 mobile phone, and this tablet uses the same user approach and stylus technology.  Make sure you get the 2014 version of this tablet.  A minor point: I wish the charger port were in a different location as it interferes with fully using my case in all configurations.  Note-taking with S-Note is amazing; it is very functional and can save your notes to picture or PDF format for mailing to others. See my reviews for the case that I really like for this device.  I wish the ""menu"" and ""back"" capacitive ""buttons"" were closer to the outer edges to make them easier to use with my case, but this is only a minor complaint.  The fact that it (and the Note 3 phone) actually have a ""back"" ""button"" is so helpful, unlike the iPhone/iPad which does not have one.  I have no issue with the size or design/build of the stylus.  32G of internal memory, with the ability to add up to a 64Gb microSD card is far better than how an iPad designs their approach to memory. Also, you can configure the closing of an app when you swith to a different display/functionality which helps battery life.  Otherwise, I end up with a zillion apps running in the background, thus draining my battery.","2014-02-27",1

"116411","Fully meets expectations","George F. Smith","RIBYND44K2AQV","Bought this for my wife as a Christmas present, and she absolutely loves it.  She had been using an earlier iPad so was already familiar with tablet technology.  She uses it for reading, checking email, web browsing, and for taking videos of our grandson during his wrestling matches.  For some reason, iPads are popular among moms and grand moms for taking wrestling videos.  She then transfers the videos to her MacBook Pro, writes them to an optical disc and gives it to the coach for analysis.  Video transfers are achieved when she syncs the iPad Air with her MBP.  She keeps it protected in a pink Otterbox, which gives the iPad a completely different look and feel.iPad Air is thinner and lighter than previous iPads and comes with a sharp Retina display.  I don't know if it's the best tablet for your money.  I do know she keeps it close at all times, and though she doesn't qualify as a geek she's worked in software maintenance most of her professional life.  If she were unhappy with it she wouldn't use it.  From my perspective as her husband it's a winner.My one complaint about all digital gadgets is that they are not nearly as tough as the old HP calculators.  Out of the box the gadgets are beautiful but then you have to stick them in some kind of case if you want to protect them, and the cases are a different look altogether.","2014-02-18",1

Toliver ""co-author""","R1RNDQI2GMSBNN","I can't compare the Kindle Fire with other tablets, but having a previous Kindle and having made purchases of books and music from Amazon over the years, I was pleased to find these readily available.  They wouldn't have been of course with another brand of tablet.  I bundled the Kindle with a stylus, headphones, and a carrying case that props up for viewing.  These enhancements make both listening and reading easy and convenient.  The sound quality for classical and folk recordings is excellent.  I happen to have heard several of the folk singers in person and noticed that in other replay systems something is always lost, both from the voices and the instrumentation.  With modestly priced earphones, not so on the Kindle.  The back lighting makes reading about the same as having a book in hand or a little sharper.  It is easy to bookmark passages and return to them though not to cite them by original page reference.  I usually use a computer for internet searches, but the Kindle serves all right for that and keeps track of website history.  It doesn't of course have all the tools of a good browser.

Duguay","R19PVDFP0EEAPY","I love the Kindle product, this is my 3rd version and without a doubt the BEST purchase for the money,( my grand kids get the old versions LOL) I bought my wife and daughter both  i-pads and they are a good machine, but really not what I was looking for.  Talked with a man who had his HD 8.9 and let me try it out, I was hooked.If your looking for all the computer bells and whistles, forget this, get a laptop or an I-pad but if you want convenience, ease of use, and a great  accessory get the E-stand protective case for it as its Well worth having, (everything works from a keyboard)to me, This little thing is Awesome, not cumbersome, small to carry and big to read and use.","2014-02-12",1

I bought cheaper ones thinking that I'd get her a nicer one when she is older.  This was a mistake since the money I spent on 2 prior cheaper ones could have been applied toward a higher quality one from the beginning and I'd be money ahead.  I've always had success with Samsung products, so should have gone this route when I first bought her a tablet.

"58755","Love the iPad 4, but buyers should be aware that buying from Amazon is not the same as buying from Apple","Bria Burton","R3G61F195V5BM9","The iPad is fabulous. Received as promised on 2/19/13. But before I even opened the factory-sealed packaging, I called Apple support to verify that the serial # (which was visible on the outside) was not registered to another Apple user.I had read in some of the reviews that people thought they were buying brand new iPads on Amazon, but received used ones. When I spoke to Apple, the person on the phone, Abby, was very helpful. She stated that the serial # I gave was not registered to an Apple user. However, it was listed as purchased back in Oct 2013. I asked if that meant this was a used iPad. She said not necessarily. As I was buying from a distributor through Amazon (Xr Distributors was the one mine came from), it could be that they bought the iPads and resold them without any customer having used them in the meantime. The downside is that the 1-year warranty that iPads come with would expire in Oct 2014, taking away from the amount of time I expected to have a warranty.I contacted the seller to let them know what Apple said, and they replied to my query within two hours. John T., who was listed as Operations Manager, apologized in the email for the inconvenience and said that all their iPads were brand new factory sealed. If I wanted to return it and buy one directly from Apple I could, or he would give me a $25 credit for the inconvenience.I really appreciated the gesture and opened the iPad to find that it was brand new, never used, and it's such a wonderful product. I'm glad I chose the 32GB as well because I shouldn't have to think twice about space issues. I also love the retina display.I'm very happy with my purchase, and I replied to the seller that I would absolutely be keeping this wonderful product and would take the $25 credit, which I'm assuming will be toward Amazon, but I won't know until I receive it I guess.","2014-02-24",1

Sometimes it's a little difficult to create powerpoints and documents because it is smaller, but I've never run into major issues. It produces great sound, I love how the apps work on the tablet, I love the keyboard hook up I purchased along with the Surface so I can type using a keyboard instead, the keyboard on the Surface itself is also very effective and accurate.

It is easy on the eyes to read books for long periods of time, and then in the next instant search the internet quickly to bring near instant information to your fingertips. There are lots of good apps to choose from and I think it is priced well. It seems to have enough memory on board to do most anything the average user may need to do. After a month of use, I couldn't tell that it was even used. The screen held up to normal use and I can't see any visible scratches on the surface.

"71039","Great tablet if its in the $200 range","keo ""Get the best deal, then get disappointed...","R3AVTPQB5Z2CML","This is Excellent for the price.  I've owned one for close to a year, and its the perfect balance between a 5"" and 10"".  Most people won't be happy with the resolution of the screen, but I think its just fine especially for taking notes.  Speed is fine for browsing and writing, although at times it can have trouble with intense games. I've owned the new Note 10.1 2014 version, and the Note 2, and I actually enjoy the Note 8.0 much better (to each their own) than either of them.  Yes the 10.1 2014 version has a nicer screen and higher specs, but if you're using this tablet for Note taking or drawing, higher everything also meant draining the battery quickly.  I just shut off the Wi-fi, turn down the screen to 35-50%, and I'm set for hours in school. Also, although the new S-note has nice new shiny excellent features, there is obvious lag in the pen, and you can't use detailed erasing when drawing like the note 8.0.  In erase mode, once you touch the current piece you have written, the eraser will remove EVERYTHING.  There are no settings to remove this.  The Note 8.0 uses very detailed erasing, and writing is very smooth.For those that are wondering if the Note 8.0 is good for taking notes at school, I'd say yes.  I've used it through 3 hour classes no problem,  and its easy to write and erase things during class.  Once I hit 60-70%, I attach a portable battery to it and juice it back to 100%.  Place the tablet in landscape, and its easy to write.  Pinch to zoom for detailed writing and you can pan around the screen using the same two fingers while dragging them along to the spots you'd like to view (at times it feels like an old type writer when pulling the page back to the beginning of the next line).  Its great for kids to practice their ABC's, just be sure to properly protect it and keep an eye on the S-pen.S-note is decent, but I prefer using the app Lecture Notes.  It costs $5, but well worth the cost if you like to customize your note taking and download PDF's to write over.  I sometimes download Coloring Book PDF's for my niece to draw on and save myself from buying books and crayons.  Its also great when a professor emails PDF's for class because you can highlight important information.  I'd sometimes ""white out"" terms, study the content, then remove the ""white out"" portions to check if I was correct on the term.  Its and excellent tool.In the end, its all about personal preference.  I like the balance of an 8"" tablet, vs bigger or smaller versions.  I think I spent too much money at the time I purchased this gadget, but if the tablet is in the $200 range, I'd say its worth every penny.  Spend time with it, and you'll be very happy with this device.","2014-03-07",1

The only  negative I have about the kindle fire HDX is adobe flash player is not available for this or any newer device, but haven't really missed it that much. A lot of things from youtube will still stream, as upgrades are made.  Some videos from Facebook play while others do not, but if it is something I really want to see I look on my laptop.

"33148","AWESOME NEW PRODUCT","realfunnytime ""eric""","R2Q8HJSF6CM1TP","I have been totally satisfied by Amazons quality with this order. The ASUS Tablets have always been my favorite products anyway, they come 2 different cloud storage programs one with 8 gb and the same. The video player that is built in is awesome, if you need to go to your home page then back to the movie it shuts down but when you hit play again it starts were you left off perfectly. The battery in this tablet is crazy long lasting, I watched 3 movies and played games for an hour and still had 35% or more charge left to go. Wifi has awesome reception and audio is good too. The HDMI MICRO cables I bought at Best buy cost $53.00 and are worth every penny.The higher the quality of the video the better.  I have tested every connect and app that is built in and few that were downloaded, and I love this Tablet. I want to buy the TF700 for the wife and test it too, but I think it will pass the test as usual for ASUS products. Cameras front and back are great crisp clear pictures and video too.","2014-03-17",1

"78449","Loving my first table!","Gary G. Gilmore ""JJ48Fan""","R1RF0LWB028FEJ","I spend 6-8 hours on a computer every day. I work from home and have a desktop & a laptop going at the same time in my office and another laptop in the family room. I didn't think I would ever like a computer without a regular keyboard. I have an iPhone and those who know me would tell you my text messages are very short. I have big fingers and I just can't do what I see many teen agers do when it come to texting. I think many of them can text faster than they can talk. Anyway. this is much easier to use for responding to email and such. But that is NOT the only thing that I like about it. I love being able to get my Prime movies and TV shows on this. I am hard of hearing and wear hearing aids. I use close captioning on my TV. I used to have Netflix, but when they went to the streaming they didn't have closed captioning. I let them know my need and they said they were working on it, but it was never available for anything I wanted to watch, so I cancelled. It has been hard for me to use the Amazon Prime Movie downloads on my TV. I have to run it through my laptop into my TV and Prime downloads didn't show closed captioning. So I was delightfully surprised that everything I have been watching on my Kindle from Amazon Prime has closed captioning! I like the larger screen and the picture is amazingly clear, crisp, with great colors. I keep finding new useful apps to download. The battery seems to last a long time. I know it lasts a lot longer than my iPhone. This thing is very light in my opinion, but it is my first pad computer so I don't have anything to compare it to. I have come to prefer taking it to client meetings over my laptop. There are probably others more geeky than me that might want some things that the Kindle doesn't have, but I love mine just the way it is.","2014-03-04",1

"122860","After the update, it's perfect","L","R18VWJ9D1Z57LL","I upgraded from an Asus transformer Infinity 10.1. I also had a Nexus 7"" 2012 (too small for me). I bought this to see if I could consolidate both sizes into one that would be big enough, but still portable.  I think the 8.4"" does a fine job at this, but I wouldn't say that if the screen resolution was subpar. Samsung's screen is top notch and makes even the smallest text readable.So for me 8.4 is doable, but only if the screen is high end, which the Samsung's is.It's also noticeably faster in general and especially in loading web pages than both my prior tablets.  This is another thing I wanted in my next tablet, and I'm satisfied with the speed.I also like the included IR blaster for controlling my TV. It has become an integral part of my couch potato command center :) No need to take my hands off my tablet to reach for the remote anymore!There is one problem though that knocks a star off for me. As also mentioned by one other reviewer here, the screen is overly sensitive at times. When I try to scroll a webpage in my browser or a pdf document in Mantano reader it will zoom in or out instead. So it's interpreting my scroll movement as a double tap. Scrolling through youtube videos will sometimes result in it playing one when I didn't select it, so it's interpreting my scrolling motion as a tap.Of course this happened on my Asus and Nexus too, but no where near as often as on the Samsung. I bought a stylus, the amPen 3 in 1 Hybrid, thinking it might help, but it is actually worse than my finger. It also skips when trying to write with it. Same with an old Griffin rubber tipped stylus I had. The amPen stylus works perfectly on my old Asus transformer though, better than a finger.I've spent hours trying to come up with a solution to this, and I did find a few things that help. First I noticed that it doesn't happen very often if I use my ring finger to navigate my tablet. My index finger and middle finger are the problem. I examined my fingers to see what could be different and came to the conclusion that my ring finger is smoother/softer than the other too. So I got out some very find sandpaper and sanded my fingertips. That seemed to help.I also did a google search on adjusting touch screen sensitivity. One hint which seems to make a big difference is to adjust the press and hold delay. Go to settings, device, accessibility, press and hold delay. The default is 0.5 seconds. I changed it to 1.0 seconds.The third thing is to clear RAM in the task manager. I notice when I first power up the tablet everything works fine, even the stylus works beautifully and scrolls and writes like a dream. After 10 minutes or so of use though it stops working. Clearing RAM can usually get it working again temporarily.So I think something is loading that affects the screen. I haven't loaded any apps that aren't also on my Asus and as I said, the stylus works fine on the Asus. So I think it's either some Samsung bloatware running in the background or 4.4 Kitkat. Asus hasn't upgraded to Kitkat yet.So if a guy has to sand his fingertips to get his tablet to work and can't use a stylus that works fine on an older tablet then the tablet probably doesn't rate 5 stars. I like the Samsung. I've got it to work with my fingers, but it's not perfect, so I'm giving it a 4.UPDATE 3/17/14:Reviewer Joe C gave some tips on how to improve lag for the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition tablet. Here they are""LAG ISSUES CAN BE IMPROVED, READ HERE:Turn on developer options by tapping ""build number"" found in the ""about"" section within options 7 times. Once developer options are turned on, scroll down to window animation transition animation, animator duration and turn each one off. You will notice no more lag for scrolling and exiting apps.To solve the home button issue where there is lag, go to S voice. Once in S voice, hit the menu button which is located left of the home button. Choose the option to ""not initiate S voice by double tapping the home button"". You will notice considerable changes in speed of the home button to wake up the screen, however it won't be snappy until there is an update.In addition, the more apps you have on your device, the more cache data your device will accumulate. Just like your web browser, you should remove your app cache data once a day or every few days to save up space. I suggest AVG memory and cache cleaner, or clean master. Also I highly suggest you install an anti-virus software like AVG on your Note 10.1 2014.""I did the developer options tips on my Tab Pro 8.4"" and also set my browser to delete cache on exit (I use NB browser pro). These tips helped remove most of the stutter I sometimes see when scrolling webpages. It also helps with the stylus problems I've been having.Turning on developer options comes with the risk that your tablet might not work right in some cases, but I haven't noticed anything bad with changing the above settings.Update: 3/19/14:Installed Clean Master to manage my RAM and cache and I think it made a noticeable improvement in my screen issues. CM also deletes junk files. I had uninstalled a mail app the regular way through the tablet's settings menu. CM found additional files that Samsung's uninstaller left behind and deleted them for me. If you install and uninstall lots of apps, over time you'll probably accumulate a fair number of junk files. CM says it can find most of these. Here's a link to it on Amazon. Clean Master It's also on Google's Play Store. Note: Be mindful of what you are doing. CM will delete your photos, videos, etc too, if you tell it too. It doesn't do this by default, and it takes extra steps to do so, but you do need to pay attention.Also, if you are having touch screen sensitivity issues there is a thread discussing it on XDA Developers you might want to read. You can find it by searching forGalaxy Tab Pro 8.4 screen sensitivity - xda-developersUpdate: 5/13/14My tablet received an update a couple days ago, which seems to have resolved the screen sensitivity. I haven't noticed any of the prior issues with sensitivity since the update. The stylus now works well and I prefer it over using my finger. So I've changed my rating from 4 to 5 stars. If you like this screen size it will be hard to find a better tablet than this one at this time.","2014-03-10",1

The price dropped, from a different seller, 24 hrs. after I ordered it & after a few emails he gave me a credit which really surprised me.As for the surface, it's a blast. Win 8.1 definitely has a learning curve but once you get configured (I’m still running XP on a new Intel extreme comp - all parts from Amazon) it runs very well. Can run as desktop or tablet & either way it's a screamer. It's accepted, so far, all my old 32 bit software including Office 2003 with no problems.If your going to tie it to a monitor (I do sometimes) get the docking port it makes all the hookups (mouse, monitor & multi usb 2&3 ports - no hub needed) much easier.Many kudos to Amazon & its suppliers.

"93438","If I could give it 5 and a half stars, I would!","B. Roth","R3LI0X1O4NUTFD","I researched tablets extensively online before purchasing this one.  There was a certain budget and size I wanted to stay in, and when all was said and done this fit the bill.  I was taken aback at some of the reviews I read about it being slow or dying all of a sudden.  Of course I don't have a crystal ball, but as to the latter I'd say if you purchase a tablet with a lithium battery and certain sensibilities, it's good to take the time to read and heed the instruction manual and treat it accordingly, especially regarding charging. If I'm not mistaken (and I don't think I am), it comes with a one-year manufacturer's warranty. All this aside, compared to other tablets in the same class, Samsung's build quality and reliability seem unparalleled.  If it just up and dies on someone, I'd say it' s a manufacturing anomaly and not the norm.  People misuse and mishandle these tablets and then complain that it's junk, but I do believe there's more to those stories than meets the eye.Anyway, the funny thing is that I used my husband's Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 to do my research.  This was over a period of a couple of weeks, and as I went along searching and researching I came to like and trust the little gizmo.  He's had it for over a year now.  No problems!  It runs like a medium-grade laptop.  Sometimes it will take a second or two to go from one web page to another, or sometimes (I think because it's so small) you have to tap a couple of times to hit a link just right, but please.  Come on.  That's not slow.  That's not horrible.  That's fine.  It's good quality.  It's a Toyota.  It's not a Porsche.The display is beautiful.  The sound is remarkably nice, nice enough to listen to without a bluetooth speaker while you're puttering.  Both ways, depending on your preference at the moment, it works great.The Dolphin Browser, I find, is awesome to use on it if you dislike certain mobile apps as do I.  You can add your favorite websites to your speed dial and just go there.As for it running slowly, again, treat it as you would a $400-$500 laptop.  Clear the cache and make sure you don't have a jillion apps running all at once.  The Active Applications widget  and Clean Master app are awesome for doing this very easily and quickly.I've only used the camera a couple of times, but for casual picture taking I'd say it's quite good!  If you want something fancy, buy a camera.  Duh.In summary, if you're looking for a portable, reliable (and, I must say, very attractive and well-built) tablet you can carry around with you to watch movies and TV shows, check email, play light games, listen to music, visit your favorite websites, read, chat, Skype, etc., etc., you really can't go wrong with this baby!  It's not an iPad, and it won't open your garage door or wash your dishes, but it is a remarkably versatile device, and I'd say it's priced well.  Amazon's dropped the price lately, so keep an eye on that.  It's comparable to the price of the Lite version (which also looks excellent), but why get lite when you can get full fat?I could not be happier with my purchase.  If that changes, I'll let you know, but I don't think it will.","2014-03-12",1

This model boots up faster than the others and is so light, even when in a case, that I hardly notice it's in my purse.  I couldn't live without it!","2014-03-03",1

"78447","Great Tablet!","Amazon Customer","R2WG9B9RSTK93G","While I would like to have access to the Google Play Store, I really love my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.  I have sideloaded many of the apps I use that are not available on Amazon.  The one I had to have is Dropbox which works perfectly on the Kindle.  The display is the best I've seen on any tablet.  I used a Galaxy Note 8.0 prior to getting the Kindle Fire HDX and am very happy with the trade.  The only thing that would make it better is to have more of the Android apps available in the Amazon App Store.","2014-03-05",1

The Play Store is exactly like the Play Store on the Android phones which is perfect bc she was able to download all of the apps she was already familiar with from my phone. Camera takes great pics! This is an exceptional tablet at a low cost.","2014-03-09",1
"89360","LOVE THIS!","NDT","R229CO0ST8C6PN","I'm an avid Apple product user and not a fan of Android phone OS.  However, this product exceeds my expectations.  The color, brightness, clarity of display is just stunning.  The sound quality is also top notch.  The speed blew me away!  It moves from app to app with great speed.  I love the ability to highlight, write notes, etc. on books and PDF files.  I also like that there is a ""on device"" and ""cloud"" app storage so I can move apps to the Cloud when I don't want them for a time.  It's very light and easy to handle.  I like the swipe texting, also.  I'm not bothered by the special offers.  It's allowed me to catch some deals I may not have noticed otherwise.  It's ways to buy apps.  While the app store isn't up to par with Apple, it's been just fine so far.  There's Candy Crush, which is important, of course :) I own an iPad, too; but it's too big and heavy for me to read and use for school work.  So husband took ownership of that and I'm in love with my new Kindle.  Seriously.  Love it.  Got a Poetic magnetic cover and it works great!","2014-03-09",1

"123139","Excellent Tablet","K.","RD2E54OBS466H","I had previously received the Ipad 2 as a gift a few years ago and while I liked it, didn't like being locked into the Apple universe. I also have had many iterations of the Kindle fire and HDX, but just wanted something a bit larger to read magazines, read my kindle books, watch videos and do some work.  This is a home run.  The screen is excellent (comparable IMHO to the HDX).  Love that you can upgrade the memory (which I did).  However, just know that apparently you cannot utilize prime books on the lending library with the Tab Pro....Amazon only lets you utilize the lending library on their devices.  So sadly, I ended my prime account as I wanted to use only one main device.  (At least this is what their help desk told me).  It's an excellent tablet, light and zippy.  Highly recommend.","2014-03-26",1

I decided to upgrade, but did not see any great advantage to getting and IPad Air for the extra bump in money.  We live very rural with no internet access, only the 3G on the iPad. I thought the slow download on the 2 was because of our setting - videos were out, pictures took a long time - so when we got the iPad 4, I was pleasantly surprised!  We can watch videos, download stories and generally just peruse the internet while not putting it down and doing something else while it loads!  The picture is marvelous, clear and sharp!  I did not think that would be so important but does make for good reading.  Overall, very glad I made the purchase.","2014-03-27",1

"91891","Mayday feature is un-freaking-believable","Purple Yo","R2HLH2UYLD1YZJ","So, I'm having some trouble getting used to this kindle since I'm used to apple products, and I wasn't sure if I had the patience to learn it until I discovered and used the mayday feature.  I'm so sick of searching message boards every time I have a problem with an electronic device or electronic service of some sort.  When web-based technology works well, it is amazingly convenient, but when there is a problem with something you've come to depend on, it is so hard to get help.  Especially with a 2 year old tugging at your...everything.  However, the Mayday feature of my new kindle is fantastic.  To have a person who can hear your voice answer your questions immediately, and solve your issue within seconds is just invaluable to this busy mom.  No more email back and forth conversations with customer service reps that didn't read the entirety of my message or didn't answer my question fully, necessitating a problem solving session lasting for days.  A person and a voice that can respond immediately is a breath of fresh air.  I would have given the Kindle HDX 3 or 4 stars before using Mayday (mostly because I prefer the Mac look but and feel and probably should have bought an ipad mini) but this service is just so impressive and beats having to go to a genius bar and wait in line for 45 minutes or more that I'm completely sold on the Kindle.","2014-03-17",1

 Length:: 9:25 MinsInitially I was not in favor of the 12.2 in, but after using the Notepro 12.2 for a while, I really got hooked. I got a chance to try the 12.2 in work environment and I am completely amazed at the power of a large inch tablet. For reading documents/pdf/books this is awesome. Especially for students! First let us compare the PRO lines from Samsung. The regular Galaxy Tab series will be out in summer based on past trends. Love the Tabpro and will do updates within a month in more detail. I will compare first the TabPROs briefly, and then give a crisp overview of the popular Tablets in market now. Then I will do in depth into the current tablet itself. I feel this will give a good perspective and enhance your buying decision. I am sure you are looking at multiple tablets to determine which sits you. If you have any questions, do ask in the forum and I will respond within a day. My video review shows Temple Run 2, YouTube, GPS Navigon, Sketching among other things.The single most fascinating part of the TabPRO lines is the resolution. Astounding 2560 x 1600 on all lines .

If you have doubts shoot me a comment, I can help!RESOLUTION:The resolution of WQXGA 2560 x 1600, and has a pixel density of 247 ppi. All the TabPROs are same resolution,  so we increase in size, the pixel density decreases. The videos were very crisp and text so sharp. The new Magazine UX interface makes the screen really pop. I was able to read magazines very easily. Aldiko and many libraries have teamed up and magazines can be checked out through the app. Resolution will blow you away.  This new Multi-Window UI that now supports up to four apps running simultaneously, each in its dedicated window. I was reading documents/manuals at work and the resolution and clarity is stunning.PROCESSING POWERExynos® 5 Octa (1.9GHz Quadcore + 1.3 GHz Quadcore), 3 GB RAM. Very powerful indeed! I have played games/watched youtube videos and have seen no lag or any latencies. Though the chip is octa core, do bear in mind only 4 cores are active at a time. This is done for minimizing heat.PRO MEANS?Tablet is certainly is a productivity tool.  This tablet is touted as Enterprise-Ready Email/Microsoft office support through a third party app.  It also has Hancom office suite which is an office suite developer in Korea. Hancom Office consists of Hanword, Hancell (Spreadsheet), and Hanshow (Presentation program). Since there is Google office, I don't know if this will be any sell in the US and other countries. does all this sound familiar to you. Yes, you have it in your laptop!STORAGEThis tabpro comes in 32/64 GB configurations.  Having the expandable memory to 64 GB is the greatest invention since sliced bread. Well, putting bunch of video/audio/books on the SD card which is so cheap these days, the tablet suddenly has more memory with no lag observed.  With prices plummeting for 64 GB cards, it is a great boon. Put all your music, books, photos on the SD card and you have a powerful computer in hand always! I personally use the 64 GB microSD card on my mobile devices. Get this mobileUltra (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging.CAMERA:Having a tablet is a plus on smaller tablets, though I hate the feature on 10 or 12"" tablets.  I personally don't use cameras as much on 10""+. If you use publicly, it is like having a big magazine in front of you. Imagine the guy in the sports stand using in front of you! The resolution is 8MP Rear + 2MP Front. Video is 1080 p 60 fps. Nowadays there is nothing much to sat of cameras, they just work for the required purpose.ERGONOMICSI personally like for home uses 8"", but  at 12""+ this is truly a laptop replacement. At 717 gm, the weight is definitely not single hand holdable.  Still less weight than laptops. For example, 11"" MacBook Air weighs 2.38 pounds. Size of this tablet is 11.64 x 8.03 x 0.31 in. The battery is 9500mAh and it came for easily couple of days for me at nominal usage in an office environment. The best part I liked is the beautiful resolution and is the best resolution on a tablet! HD videos are crisp.  The tablet is marked as PRO which means Samsung us really trying the enterprise customers, though nothing prevents one from getting for home personal use.SOUNDExcellent sound system with stereo speakers and microphone. I was able to ask questions to Google Now and get precise answers.MISCI tested OTG capability and it is great to have a external USB support.  USB Host is one of the most undernoticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. I have used it with Alfa AWUS036H for a wireless project with Android PCAP Capture from reputable Kismet wireless.Having a GPS is great for immediate needs and I could get immediate lock on this tablet. Wi-Fi is 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band. Also has infrared which cas be used for WatchON as a TV remote control. Worked straightaway on Samsung TV. This is also great for sharing your tablet with family members, multi user mode lets different users log in separately, so you each see only your own apps, backgrounds, and email.APP POWERI tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you. It's almost like the camera/lens analogy in the DSLR space. What good it is to have a great DSLR body if you have no good lens? Same with Tablet body and apps you have. Apart from official tasks, I tried apps from my personal Google Play apps.WolframAlpha (I can go on for hours praising this. This is a truly genius app powered by hundreds of supercomputers in the background. Wolfram is a computational genius). Well worth the $3 price.Withings HealthMate. (another remarkable app great UI/UX). I use Pulse and the integration with it as well as Weight machine is very good.23andMe app (I love their reports)Aldiko Book Reader Premium (absolutely love it, many libraries have magazines for checkout)Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAndroid Central app (great and must have for Android users)Androidify (kids love it)Angry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt Car gameBattery Monitor Widget Pro (a great app)BeyondPod (use it daily!)BoxChromeCNET TVDictionary M-W PremiumNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)TOM TOM app (has some advantages over NAVIGON)Google Navigation/Earth/Maps using a portable MiFi boxGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Google Keep/Keyboard/Drive/Search/Books/Voice/HangoutsEbayFlipboardLinkedinGoogle Music (Awesome, I have now upto 10,000 songs halfway through Google's 20K Limit)Tapatalk HD (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & AudiobooksMicrosoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for AndroidTwit.TvSkypeRealCalc Plus (Awesome calculator app)Wolfram AlphaZillowPlenty of WidgetsAsk questions, the reviews cannot do full justice.

"68987","Didn't think...","Linda Hall ""A truck driver""","R3IFGDEFCH5AM3","I didn't think this would be any better than my old (well not really old only a little over a year) Kindle Fire. But, the 1.9"" makes a big difference. Plus the internet and the videos and games download much faster.I love being able to fling things onto my TV (I also have the Fire TV which is excellent). I can even fling my books onto the TV (though I was told by a rep that you can't). Since I make bread and like to try new recipes this is excellent. I can put the recipe on my TV and see it from the kitchen (set your Kindle to stay on for an hr or so).It also makes some of the games  more fun. Mostly the hidden object games, the action games can't be used on TV unless it's strictly for others to watch you play. But, the hidden objects are easier to spot on the TV.Also,  I would keep the special offers, I've found many good deals with the special offers and they don't pop-up. They're only there when you open the Kindle and you have the option to ignore it or open it to check it out.I can't find one bad issue with this HDX. Even the battery life is very good. I left it on with the internet all day yesterday (well, for about 12hrs anyway) and finally plugged it in with 29% still left.Thanks Amazon for another great product!!!","2014-04-15",1

One of my pet peeves is all this high tech gadgets are great and useful tools , however nobody shows you how to use them or wants to support them. That goes for software and hardware. You have to be technically adept or watch utube videos to learn how to use the brand new high tech stuff you just bought.

"111882","Perfect Device","Jeffrey Kaufman","R3DFIITKLXX5TZ","I read reviews on things before I buy anything, and after reading the reviews here and elsewhere [...]I decided to try this tablet out, and after a month of hard use, I can honestly say that it will meet your needs for anything from business to craft, to playing games. Console quality play with games like Modern Warfare 4 from Gameloft run smooth, and all my apps I need to use everyday are easily integrated into this tablet. Samsung Knox, and push for emails is excellence by far. It's like having two tablets in one. With knox I can work on the business side of my life, and with the normal side of the device, I can do anything I need.So far it had blown my iPad completely out of the water. Screen to screen, it has the better picture. More in-depth color, sharp images,  well defined textures and clarity.  Individual strands of hair in pictures seem to pop out, it's really amazing. Processor power is excellent and fast. I can run my photo shop app easily, and still work of word processing sheets. Very impressive for me, was this review, and now that I own it, awesome.

Exactly a year later, the machine had been broken.So, I had to decide between iPad Air and Galaxy Note 10.1 2014.....Because of my class, I had to but Samsung product again.However, as you guys already well know, there are not many apps on Adroid. Still iTunes has a huge of app store.iPad air is very light and clear.If you are student, I strongly recommend iPad air instead of Galaxy Note 10.1. Of course if your considering is not writing only.There are many apps even school such as library.","2014-04-14",1

But I've also purchased Autodesk Sketchbook Express, and it's amazingly smooth. The closest device in terms of weight and size would be the iPad Air, but there's no reason to buy an iPad Air for almost 8 to 9 times more money, for marginally better experience. Once of the minor issues is the battery life. When watching movies, you may be able to get 6 or 7 hours. It's OK, but I know that the iPad Air does about twice this. Still, there's no reason to buy an iPad Air just to read books and watch Netflix or draw on Sketchbook, if I can do all that on this device.","2014-04-11",1

"122770","Very Good Upgrade!","Chris Leach","R36MO7V7FYI5BW","Ok, I bought my nephew the Galaxy Tab 8.0 for Christmas and have been using it and enjoyed it so, that I was about to buy the same thing for me.I seen that the GT Pro 8.4 had come out and had a better screen than the GT 8.0, so I thought I would study a little about it, read a few reviews online and then I would decide on which to get.I can say that I definitely chose right.Just some quick Pro's from my use so far :Width wise it seems smaller than the GT 8.0.Screen is heads above the GT 8.0The .4"" screen size is NOT noticeable at all.  My hands hold the GT Pro as well as the GT 8.0.Loads apps/books faster than the GT 8.0.  It should with a quadcore processor.The fake leather backing on the back of the GT Pro is nice, it isn't as likely to slide on any surface that is not flat.Charge seems to be holding up, but I have only been using it recently for reading books.The speaker seem good considering this thing really isn't being advertised as a mp3 player.Some quick Con's:When I slide my finger to go to another screen, it stutters at times. (haven't had time to see if there is a fix or not for this)The fake leather on the back just seems tacky and not right for the GT Pro.  I don't hate it, but it seems something better could be there instead.The speakers and sound aren't what they should be, in my opinion.  Maybe they should invest into Beats audio or some other brand of audio to up the sound quality.  The GT Pro, should have better sound, not just a better screen.This has been a pleasure to use so far, though I clearly have not put it completely through its' paces, I have used it and abused it a bit, and it does very well.I would recommend this over the Galaxy Tab 8.0 in a heartbeat.If you are struggling between the 2, the Pro is the one to get, even at the cost, but you can't go wrong with either really, but the Pro is a step up that you can see and feel.","2014-04-10",1

"61134","The best tablet at  $150","Souvik Pal","R3MKO3DOK4QI1H","Bought this as a gift for my parents. What can I say about Nexus except that it is great! I don't have to re-certify the fact that its clearly one of the all time best 7"" best tablet ever sold. I have a iPad2 and in terms of silky smooth touch response, iPad is still may be a few points ahead than nexus, but my iPad2 cost me well in excess of $500 versus the nexus at $150, which raises the question is iPad really worth that much extra cash? This is the 2012 version, and the 2013 nexus is even better what I have heard. My iPad2 is showing signs of aging, so I will probably buy 2013 version as well. If you are looking for a 7"" tablet, this is the must have tablet. Believe me,  the other 7"" tabs are not worth the extra cash. I know in 10"" tab genre, Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 and iPad air are the major players, but nexus beats everyone else in 7"" form factor tablet market.The only major drawback with this one is that USB on the go is not enabled by default. You have to root it which may not be trivial for normal people.","2014-04-17",1
"122759","Clearly the best 8 inch tablet, worth the price premium","Snowfall86","RBUA5C2XZFY6F","After returning 2 defective Nexus 7's, I decided to take a look at the LG G Pad 8.3 and this Galaxy Pro 8.4. You really should get to a store and play with each before trying. The Galaxy Pro 8.4 is far and away the higher quality device...but it will cost you. It's about $70 more than the LG G Pad, but in my opinion it's worth it. This is not a ""budget"" once a year device. It is future-proofed to own for at least 2 years, with the fastest processors on the market and Android KitKat.PROS- Remember how it used to be fun to open a new computer? Samsung makes you feel good about your purchase - as of April 2014 they throw in $25 of Google Play credit, 2 years of 50GB Dropbox space, 3 months of SiriusXM App and Hulu, 2 years of remote desktop access, 1 year of in flight Wi-Fi...you get the picture. It's nice to be rewarded with a little more than a device and USB cable. Samsung is one of the top players in tablets, and you can tell companies want you to devote screen space to them.- Top tier specs. You will not find a better spec sheet on a tablet for the rest of 2014, unless you REALLY want wireless charging.- Premium feel. The biggest knock on design of previous Galaxy devices is the cheap, plastic-y feel. That's completely changed with the leather back. You don't have to use a case for this, since the back is the kind of material that won't scratch if you leave it on a table.- Obviously, the display. But you have to see it in person to believe. PPI's or brightness stats don't do it justice. Just look at it next to the iPad Mini Retina or G Pad...the Galaxy Pro wins easily.- 2MP front facing camera is a step up from most tablets for video callsCONS- As a Nexus 5 owner, the TouchWiz UI is annoying. It's not terrible (except for that keyboard, yuck! download Google Keyboard and use that), there are some decent features added, but would prefer the option of going stock.- Left side can get a little warm if you are using heavily for a while. I have read the internal temperature of the device is similar to other tablets, however the material on the back does not contain heat very well.So while the Galaxy Pro is about $70 more than most Android tablets in this size range, I believe the perks and quality of the tablet make it worth the extra cost.","2014-04-07",1

"111750","Much improved over older tablets","Tennesseeuser","R3NXAC3FN957C9","The processor is much better than the Toshiba I used to use.  It also can display more than one page at a time, which is a nice feature.  It has the annoying property of most tablets (thanks Apple) that there are apps you cannot get rid of, and even when you turn them off, you get a warning (probably not true) that turning this off might impact other apps you are using.  My guess is that it limits the amount of free data they can mine from your use of the tablet.  I'm sure there would be denials about that.And still a nice tablet, boots up fast, has many nice features,  Comparable to an iPad, and it has a micro SD port.","2014-04-01",1

"116491","Worth the price","Curt","R1N9CVZX6UAJ58","This is my first Apple device and I have to say I'm loving it. I use it for a small business and it has all the apps I need. I love the size of the device - large screen yet the tablet is nice and thin and light. The case that I got for it adds a very minor amount of bulk. As a new Apple user I was impressed by how easy the interface is to use. Since I have to store a lot of photos for my business, I purchased the 32gb model and I'm glad I did. Even though I store most of my stuff on a cloud app, I'm glad I don't have to worry about filling up my tablet.PROS:GREAT battery life. I literally had this on for 3 days straight during a convention and it was used constantly - just barely made it down to 20% battery by the end of the 3 days. Charges back up fairly fast tooScreen size is big but not too big, tablet is lightweight and thinEverything runs fast and smoothCONS:Cord of the charger it came with is very short (just a minor gripe, but still!)Screen gets dirty easily and I haven't found a decent screen protector yet (another minor gripe)Safari, the default browser, sucks. Install something else! I recommend chrome or firefoxI know the ipad air is pricey, but I found this to be much better and easier to use than my laptop, which I have now given to my fiance for his use. Definitely recommend it!","2014-05-01",1

"117572","Wonderful product, just a few minor complaints.","Nathan","R3AGVWFT9LP3JM","I've had my ipad for two months now and I am obsessed! It's so easy to use and I take it with me everywhere for work. I have two small complaints:1. The camera has no flash.2.  Tha calculator is not located in the same menu as for an iPhone (the one when you swipe up from the bottom of the screen - I don't remember what it's called). This makes accessing the calculator, which I use a lot for work, very inconvenient.3. Many apps for the iPhone (Instagram, snapchat) have not been adapted for use on the ipad. This isn't necessarily an ipad issue, but definitely something to consider.Overall, it's a great product! I firmly believe that you get what you pay for. Apple is pricey, but it's worth it and they have wonderful customer service. Highly recommend.","2014-05-04",1
"124364","Perfect for my kids","Brent Hollander","R2FLK0T8BJECGN","I ordered this tablet with the intention of giving it to my 2 children who are constantly using my ipad. It was a good deal and now my kids have something to play with and I can have my ipad all to myself now.As for the product itself, It has a decent amount of memory and speed to play apps and browse the web. I like the size because it is very compact and easy to carry around when you are travelling. The battery life is not bad, but really depends on what you are doing which has a direct effect on your battery.My kids use it to watch videos on youtube and play some games. I can also plug in my hdmi cable and hook it up to the kids tv when they want to watch a movie which is awesome.

"83405","Great for those who travel often and live overseas!","Cristiano","R2ADYOQYG3QG05","I got the Kindle Fire HDX 7"" (32GB) for my wife as a belated surprise birthday gift and she absolutely loves it! We've had Amazon Prime for awhile and we now get to maximize the value of Prime membership as the Kindle Fire allows us to access the growing selection of free movie/TV content!I'm a bit of techie and my experiences with tablets have been quite ambivalent. Here's my history:- Amazon Kindle DX (hated it b/c it was too slow, clunky; sold it on craigslist after 3 months)- Apple iPad 2nd gen (loved it at first but when I tried to use for productivity, it was horrible; sold on craigslist after 6 months)- Apple iPad mini (after playing with it at a store, I didn't feel it was worth it so when I got it as a gift I immediately sold it on craigslist and got the Canon S90 camera instead)Despite this disappointment with tablets, I thought the Kindle HDX was a good value at its price point and would make a great gift for my wife. So I pulled the trigger and let me tell you, my wife is so happy (I'm a bit tempted to get one for myself). The screen is crisp and rich in colors, the OS is fast, form factor is perfect for personal viewing, super light (very important when watching a 2 hr movie), all previous electronic Kindle books look great on it, and the chambray cover I bought for her looks great. Also Amazon Prime membership makes the Kindle HDX have so much more value than the more expensive Apple iPads. We live in Korea and travel a lot so my wife is looking forward to using her new Kindle HDX on long transcontinental flights (now that they allow you to downloads some of the content).In order to lift the geolocation restrictions, we purchased witopia VPN ($50/yr) and setup the IPSec protocol. It was simple and worked right away at HD streaming quality! Hope this helps someone! A great gift!","2014-05-25",1

"84488","So far, it's my favorite device","a-train","R315MP0NIYDJ0G","I gave is 5 stars because the device itself is solid. I went with the Kindle Fire HDX because the specs were the best out there for the price point that it's set at, plus I got a Prime member deal on it.Movies look amazing on it, the sound from the built in speakers were surprisingly good, and it has plenty of processing power to do everything you ask of it.The blue haze on the edge while viewing a white doc is such a NON-ISSUE. First of all it's only there on a complete white screen. Secondly, it's barely there, and you have to look for it. It's non in your main focal point, so you're never going to REALLY see it. I can't say this enough: It's very minimal! If no one mentioned it, you probably wouldn't even notice that it's there. The other things that the Kindle is great at completely overshadow this.The app store has plenty, and it's only getting more. With a little research you can get whatever Android app you want. For example, I like Chrome for web browsing, and I was able get the app on my Kindle in a couple of minutes.Being a Prime member, and able to download prime instant content is awesome. I don't have to rely on wireless connectivity to enjoy movies on the go.This was a great purchase for me. The only regret is that I didn't get the 32GB version.","2014-05-09",1

It's great for downloading apps and surfing the web.I was nervous about getting a refurbished device, but I have had zero issues - and the one year warranty is a nice safety net, too.","2014-05-01",1

"123609","Good product at excellent price!","Phong Truong","R3FST1U1WQWGA7","I bought this tablet and the black one.  It's well made.  The material in the back cover is aluminum.  My main usage is to easily copy movies, and music on either external sd or usb hard drive to watch while I am traveling.  This tablet can do just that.  I can just drop the movies (mp4 and MVK) and music on the external hard drive, plug it in the tablet and play. Simple and straight forward.  This is how it should be instead of going through some middle application.  My wife and I really like this tablet.","2014-05-20",1

"124141","GREAT TABLET, GREAT PRICE!","jwstaton","R2DRMFHAWQNZEF","This is my review of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 10.1. This review is not incentivized by Samsung in any way. I purchased the product for my own use.What is it?The Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 is the aforementioned company’s latest foray into the midrange tablet market. With these tablets you’re not likely to find a “retina display” or anything over 720p resolution, but they’re more reasonably priced, and therefore, more likely to be adopted by more people.SpecificationsProcessor: 1.2 GHz Quad CoreMemory: 1.5GBStorage: 16GB with additional microSD slotDisplay: 1280×800Operating System: Android Kit Kat 4.4 with Samsung’s TouchWiz UIAs you can see, those specs really aren’t too shabby, but they’re definitely not bleeding edge technology. However, having the latest and greatest isn’t always the best. For example, I recently purchased the higher end Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 and was utterly disappointed in it. Yes, the screen was beautiful but you could tell that not a lot of games had been properly coded for that resolution as the HD graphics appeared pixelated and blocky. Also, the Tab Pro suffered from massive lag and stuttering when when navigating through the operating system. You can read about my experience with that tablet here. It was promptly returned to Best Buy.Back to the Galaxy Tab 4.As mentioned earlier, it runs Kit Kat 4.4 with Samsung’s custom TouchWiz user interface over top. In my opinion, this isn’t a bad thing since I have never been a fan of HTC’s Sense UI. It sadly still comes packed full of bloatware that I almost always remove if possible.Initial ThoughtsBeing an ex-member of the cult of Steve Jobs, I am still getting used to the Android world and the lack of high resolution displays in some products. The Galaxy S5, which I own, has the best display and form factor on the market right now. Are you listening Apple? Thankfully, there are cheaper Android tablets available that still offer a high quality user experience.Once you go through the obligatory setup screens and sync your applications, the tablet is zippy and runs with no lag whatsoever. Overall memory utilization is low when using several apps at once and multi-tasking.DisplayOK, this is a 720p display. You will notice a difference if using an S5 and then the Galaxy Tab 4 – but let’s not compare the two. The 1280×800 screen is actually quite beautiful and bright. This is one of the brighter screens I’ve seen on a midrange tablet. Text is sharp as are the graphics, both are quickly rendered thanks to the 1.5GB RAM and quad core processor. Yes, I think it should be a 1080p panel, but it’s a $319 tablet.PerformanceI was able to open apps and switch between them fairly quickly. This little tablet is definitely more responsive than it’s bigger, more expensive brother. Even under heavy use the Tab 4 performed excellent. It’s able to handle video encoded to 1080p with no stutter, even though it’s obviously rendered at 720p on the screen. No complaints at all about performance.Final ImpressionsI’m still an Apple fanboy, just now living in an Android world. I really like the Galaxy Tab 4. It’s fast, responsive, light, and does what I need it to do. I feel like for the most part, I could ditch my laptop when traveling. That is, as long as I’m not running a GoPro, or editing HD video.The display is not as sharp as I like, but the applications and games I use are not upated to be displayed yet at the higher resolutions on the Tab Pro.Kit Kat has grown, the OS takes up about 4GB of the internal 16GB, and by the time you add-in the Samsung applications and associated bloatware, you have only about 9GB of usable space. That almost sounds like a Surface tablet, no? LOL Sorry, couldn’t resist. Samsung says the answer is to use a microSD card – which you will want to do immediately. They state on their site, that a maximum of 64GB is supported, although I am tempted to buy a 128GB and try it. I know those work in the S5.So, should you buy it? If you like new gadgets, sure. If you want a great performing Android tablet for a great price, absolutely. I can’t really find anything wrong with this little guy. It’s a keeper.UPDATEI pre-ordered the Galaxy Tab 4 on Amazon at $349. It was released May 1st, and it looks like the price was dropped to $319.99, making it an even better value.","2014-05-02",1

"123323","absolutely good","ptecsaba","R3H7OCG145FPU1","Nice tablet just what I thought it would be. As musician I perfectly read PDF music sheets and easy to use. I also use it for lots of meetings and on the ho stuff and the battery life is amazing. Yes it takes to charge but it is a 10000mah battery not a 4000mah as most laptops. Overnight charge is perfect. With all the application at hand it is a windows laptop comparison. Of course android has to polish a lot to be smoothy all the time and take office tasks 100% hopefully it will come soon. For the price and performance it is a 100% review. Slimmer than most of my uni books why not then a notepro?","2014-05-21",1
